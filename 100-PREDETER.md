PREDETERMINISM
==============

There is one last concept that needs to be shared, and that is the idea that there can be almost countless recombinations of archetypes, and therefore almost countless connections of tholons from the beginning (the first duality) to the end (the final duality of any archetype). This implies that within the thologram exists every path of creation and/or growth that is possible *at that moment in time*. As new recombinations come into being, new paths emerge, but for the most part, these new paths will emerge from the ‘bottom', or end-points, of the hierarchy, as these are the most unstable and dynamic. Each tholon represents a ‘step' in the path. New paths are rarer as we move up the hierarchy as these higher-order tholons have achieved a stable state and short of radical change in energy they will not change. The force of the energy that would be needed to affect a change is inversely proportional to their generation.

An example of this would be the creation of a new element in the periodic charts. All elements past the element of uranium are man-made, so they are new creations, but they are also extremely unstable and unsustainable and don't last very long. A new stable path even a little way up from the ‘bottom' would dramatically alter reality, as we have seen with the creation of a quantum and digital perspective of existence. There may be many options along that path, and they are always emerging, but they are finite.

Starting from the beginning, immediately upon the first awareness of a non-existent dot in the void of nothingness, that awareness and intention began self-replicating into smaller and smaller divisions. These divisions stop at some point where no sustainable patterns can be achieved, perhaps because the difference is too small or weak, or the dissimilarities are too great, or other reasons. The depth of a tholon's scope can be described as the difference between two states, the delta of the duality of that scope, similar to the definition of voltage we saw above, which presumably gets smaller and smaller with each generation (but not necessarily).

As the parents and children of a tholon change, so too will that tholon adapt to these changes by having its scope adjusted. In doing so the thologram is *problem-solving*. More than that, it is doing this in a heuristic manner, i.e. a manner based on experience. How? Because the (only successful) changes that have been made in the past resulted in changes (of which only the successful remain) to the entire thologram and the consequence of those changes define the context of each tholon's current condition.

This is not very different from the idea that the wave function for any and every single electron extends to every corner of existence. The wave function of one electron on your ballpoint pen in your desk drawer is interfering with the wave function of every other electron in the Universe (albeit on an infinitesimally small range).

The working hypothesis is that the thologram has a memory of everything that has ever happened to it that resulted in a successful change, and this is all recorded and passed on through each and every sustainable pattern. However, there can be many tholons occupying the same space because of the embedded nature of tholons, so if you reference a tholon at the “bottom” of the thologram, you are implicitly referencing every parent tholon back to the very first tholon. What this suggests is that any instance of a tholon is also an implicit reference to many tholons. For example, the Duracell battery in your mouse is an explicit instance of a *Duracell battery* tholon, but it is also an implicit instance of *batteries*, which is part of the *chemistry* tholon, which is part of the *elements* tholon, which is part of the *subatomic particle* tholon, etc.…

What this tells us is that each instance is a 3D perspective of a very multi-dimensional energy, and we can speculate that at some level of dimension there is a *hyper dimensional-thing* that, in one moment, represents every possible situation as one ‘path' from the first tholon to the last child tholon, but which we 3D dwellers experience as part, present, and future (like the 3D ball passing through 2D space example previously).

This instantiation of “bumping into each other” is the result of countless steps that had to happen starting with the Big Bang. The steps that it took for Bob and his ancestors to arrive at this point and time we'll call path B, and the steps it took for Carol to arrive at this point in time we'll call path C. Path B and path C already existed in the mega-space, and Bob and Carol just happen to be the current instantiations of a particular stable expression (human tholon) of energy (awareness), that are traveling that path. There are effectively an infinite number of paths, but that is not important. What is important is that the record of each of their paths exists, as does the record of where the path(s) of the future will lead.

All of this is to say that every path that can be traveled by any instance already exists. I suspect we tend to wander through this matrix of possibilities in the same manner bacteria wander aimlessly about in their puddles of plasma, or whatever their world is made of.

Even in the world of bacterial meandering, we see a pattern. Ironically, it is the inverse of a Bell curve, in that a group of bacteria released at the same time starts out relatively coherent and eventually disperses to incoherence. It's almost as if the archetypes tend toward order, while the instances tend toward chaos. Because each tholon has a record of all the successful instances that came before it, each tholon has its own unique path, but all tholons begin at the same point.

In the early generations of the thologram, the numbers of paths are limited, and with the additional generations, the number of paths increase. This movement may appear random, but not only does it disperse according to a Bell curve, it actually follows the same rules as the thologram itself in that it is self-similar and fractal in
nature.<sup>[126](#ref_126)</sup>

Although this sounds like predeterminism, which it is, in effect, there are so many paths that can be traveled that for all intents and purposes predeterminism doesn't apply. Tholonically speaking, the primary purpose of existence is to form every possible combination of sustainable patterns.

Although a bit of a tangent, it's worth stating here that the idea of reincarnation is a flawed understanding of a misunderstood process. What we believe to be past life experiences are collective memories associated with the path we happen to be traveling and which we identify with mainly due to our ego's limitation of relating everything to one's self. This is why many people who believe in reincarnation will also believe they were the same (well known) person in a past life, and there will naturally be more people traveling the well-worn paths of current archetypes simply because these paths are the paths of least resistance.

There are some real-world examples of how instances follow a preexisting path. Here are some of the fairly well-known stories of “coincidences” that demonstrate this concept.<sup>[127](#ref_127)</sup>

### King Umberto I' double

In Monza, Italy, King Umberto I went to a small restaurant for dinner, accompanied by his aide-de-camp, General Emilio Ponzia-Vaglia. When the owner took King Umberto's order, the King noticed that he and the restaurant owner were virtual doubles, in face and in build. Both men began discussing the striking resemblances between each other and found many more similarities.

a\) Both men were born on the same day, of the same year, (March 14<sup>th</sup>, 1844).

b\) Both men had been born in the same town.

c\) Both men married a woman with the same name, Margherita.

d\) The restaurateur opened his restaurant on the same day that King Umberto was crowned King of Italy.

e\) On the 29th July 1900, King Umberto was informed that the restaurateur had died that day in a mysterious shooting accident, and as he expressed his regret, he was then assassinated by an anarchist in the crowd.

*The pattern was identical but was instantiated twice in two different contexts.*

### Twin Boys, twin lives

The twin Ohio boys were separated at birth, being adopted by different families. Unknown to each other, both families named the boys James. Both James grew up not even knowing of the other, yet both sought law-enforcement training, both had abilities in mechanical drawing and carpentry, and each had married women named Linda. They both had sons whom one named James Alan and the other named James Allan. The twin brothers also divorced their wives and married other women – both named Betty. And they both owned dogs which they named Toy. Forty years after their childhood separation, the two men were reunited. (Source: Reader's Digest, January 1980)

*This looks like two instances of the same tholon.*

### Three strangers on a Train, with complementary last names

In the 1920s, three Englishman were traveling separately by train through Peru. At the time of their introduction, they were the only three men in the railroad car. Their introductions were more surprising than they could have imagined. One man's last name was Bingham, and the second man's last name was Powell. The third man announced that his last name was Bingham-Powell. None were related in any way. (Source: Mysteries of the Unexplained)

*Here, these three men, although having different lives, clearly shared some other details. Does this suggest that even our names can be instances of a pattern? I have some experience with this personally. My entire life I have been fascinated with the lore of El Paso, Texas. I had never been to El Paso prior to when I drove through in my 40s at around 4 AM in the morning. It was an ugly town, but I found it incredibly alluring, for reasons I could not explain. Years later I discovered that the most famous Old West lawman of El Paso, considered a hero in them there parts, and I shared the same name. I can't say if that is why I felt the way I did about El Paso, but these are two details that seem both very rare, and possibly very connected.*

### Richard Parker

Edgar Allan Poe wrote a story called “The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym”. This was a story about four survivors of a shipwreck who were in an open boat for many days before they decided to kill and eat the cabin boy whose name was Richard Parker. Some years later, in 1884, the Mignonette, a 52 for English Yacht, was capsized by a wave as they were traveling northwest of the Cape of Good Hope. The four survivors found themselves together in an open boat for many days. Eventfully, the three senior members of the crew killed and ate the cabin boy, whose name was Richard Parker.

*Here a pattern took form as both a story and an experience. Perhaps Poe was able to tune into certain patterns and share them. Perhaps that is what creativity or genius is; the ability to tap into patterns that have yet to become instantiated.*

### Titanic's destiny, Titanian's salvation

Morgan Robertson, in 1898, wrote “Futility”. It described the maiden voyage of a transatlantic luxury liner named the Titan. Although it was touted as being unsinkable, it strikes an iceberg and sinks with much loss of life. In 1912 the Titanic, a transatlantic luxury liner widely touted as unsinkable strikes an iceberg and sinks with great loss of life on her maiden voyage. In the Book, the Month of the Wreck was April, same as in the real event. There were 3,000 passengers on the book; in reality, 2,207. In the Book, there were 24 Lifeboats; in reality, 20.

Months after the Titanic sank, a tramp steamer was traveling through the foggy Atlantic with only a young boy on watch. It came into his head that it had been thereabouts that the Titanic had sunk, and he was suddenly terrified by the thought of the name of his ship – the Titanian. Panic-stricken, he sounded the warning. The ship stopped, just in time: a huge iceberg loomed out of the fog directly in their path. The Titanian was saved.

*This is similar to the preceding story, but the interesting detail is how the Titanian was able, due solely to the previous instances of “Futility” and the Titanic, to alter what seemed inevitable. It seems there may be predeterminism, but it seems we can jump from one predetermined path to another (so I guess we have free will when it comes to what predetermined path we will wander down?).*

### A writer's plum pudding

In 1805, French writer Émile Deschamps was treated to some plum pudding by the stranger Monsieur de Fortgibu. Ten years later, he encountered plum pudding on the menu of a Paris restaurant and wanted to order some, but the waiter told him the last dish had already been served to another customer, who turned out to be de Fortgibu. Many years later in 1832 Émile Deschamps was at a diner and was once again offered plum pudding. He recalled the earlier incident and told his friends that only de Fortgibu was missing to make the setting complete — and in the same instant the now senile de Fortgibu entered the room.

*Pudding seems to be the pattern that instantiates under very specific conditions, such as when Deschamps and de Fortgibu are near one another. Proximity, at least, in this case, seems to have an effect on the probability of what patterns might instantiate. One can only guess why pudding was the pattern they created.*

### A novel that unsuspectedly described the spy next door

When Norman Mailer began his novel Barbary Shore, there was no plan to have a Russian spy as a character. As he worked on it, he introduced a Russian spy in the U.S. as a minor character. As the work progressed, the spy became the dominant character in the novel. After the novel was completed, the U.S. Immigration Service arrested a man who lived just one floor above Mailer in the same apartment building. He was Colonel Rudolf Abel, alleged to be the top Russian spy working in the U.S. at that time. (Source: Science Digest)

*Here is an example of one pattern instantiating simultaneously, and again, in close proximity.*

### A falling baby saved twice by the same man

In Detroit sometime in the 1930s, a young (if incredibly careless) mother must have been eternally grateful to a man named Joseph Figlock. As Figlock was walking down the street, the mother's baby fell from a high window onto Figlock. The baby's fall was broken and both man and baby were unharmed. A stroke of luck on its own, but a year later, the very same baby fell from the very same window onto poor, unsuspecting Joseph Figlock as he was again passing beneath. And again, they both survived the event. (Source: Mysteries of the Unexplained)

*If proximity is a factor, we have to wonder if Figlock never walked down that street, would the baby have ever fallen?*

### A determined bullet

Henry Ziegland thought he had dodged fate. In 1883, he broke off a relationship with his girlfriend who, out of distress, committed suicide. The girl's brother was so enraged that he hunted down Ziegland and shot him. The brother, believing he had killed Ziegland, then turned his gun on himself and took his own life. But Ziegland had not been killed. The bullet, in fact, had only grazed his face and then lodged in a tree. Ziegland surely thought himself a lucky man. Some years later, however, Ziegland decided to cut down the large tree, which still had the bullet in it. The task seemed so formidable that he decided to blow it up with a few sticks of dynamite. The explosion propelled the bullet into Zealand's head, killing him. (Source: Ripley's Believe It or Not!)

*The pattern here is that bullet and the intention behind it. Intentions alone can be their own pattern.*

From one perspective you could see all these stories as extremely unlikely coincidences. From the tholonic perspective, each of these paths and each of these profiles are some of the almost countless patterns that managed to attain enough stability to instantiate.

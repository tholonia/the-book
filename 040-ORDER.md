ORDER
=====

###### On every scale of existence, order arises out of chaos and then returns to chaos. Each cycle can take millennia or nanoseconds. This is the cycle of existence.

Everything that exists must follow the laws of existence, for the penalty of not following the laws is non-existence. This is why we call it the *Laws of Physics* and not the *Highly Recommended Suggestions of Physics*.

These laws of physics can change between one state of matter and another. Before we look at some of the laws, let's look at the scopes that these laws must function within.

The Scope of Order
------------------

Some laws are *universal*, and some are *local*. However, what is *universal* to us may well be *local* but in a much larger context that we cannot see beyond.

An example of a *local* law might be the Standard Model of particle physics that describes the relationship between three of the four fundamental forces and the elementary particles that make up the matter in our universe. This is a set of laws and constants that apply to particle physics. You don't see this model replicated in larger systems because the model only makes sense when dealing with the reality of sub-atomic particles. Likewise, Oort constants only apply to the rotational properties of the Milky Way.

Science calls the scope of our everyday Newtonian reality *Macrorealism* <sup>[1](#ref_004)</sup> or *Local Realism*, and the subatomic scope is called *Quantum Mechanics*. Understanding how different laws operate in different scopes is an area of intense research and has led to such landmark experiments like Bell's inequalities (the math that enables the distinction between two different views of reality, typically the relativistic view vs. the quantum view), Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox (which speculates that every particle in the universe knows the state of every other particle in the universe at all time, and that no two particles in the universe have the same state), and the Leggett–Garg inequality (which states that in the quantum world something can be in two states at the same time, which is impossible for the macroscopic world), to name a few.

#### **Claim 8:** Local laws and constants are valid only within the context of their scope. 

An example of universal laws or patterns that span many scopes might be the Fibonacci sequence (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144,233, 377...) and its constant ratio of Phi*φ*, also called the Golden Ratio (1:1.618). This number is the ratio that not only pops up in galaxies and seashells but, according to some evolutionary and chemical scientists<sup>[5](#ref_005)</sup>, is the ratio that keeps everything in existence in order and is the shape of space-time itself.

Another universal law might be simple fractal math formulas, like *f(x)= x*<sup>2</sup>*-1, which seem to mimic nature and* can be found across all forms of existence<sup>[6](#ref_006)</sup>, suggesting that self-similarity is a universal property. *Power laws* explain how a relative change in one measurement can result in a proportional relative change in another measurement (i.e. logarithmic or exponential), and we see these across all levels of existence as well. These universal laws can be found in astronomy, physics, biology, meteorology, cosmology, mathematics, economics, and many other areas including society, wealth and work distribution, competition, media exposure, and much more.

Even though there many, many more classes of laws, for this writing we are only going to use these two general scopes of laws, the *local* and the *universal*, because no matter what laws may exist, they will fall into one of these two scopes (or children of these scopes).

Local laws may be local, but they can affect everything that is built upon them. Everything is made of atoms, and atoms are the size they are because of *Plank's constant*, which is the relationship between the mass and the frequency of the particles that make up an atom. If that constant were to change the entire universe would be radically different, if it even existed at all. If Plank's constant changed from 6.2618 x 10<sup>-34</sup> to 6.2618 x 10<sup>-20</sup>, the radius of an atom would go from being too small to see 100 times the distance to the nearest star!

On a more realistic level, consider a bridge made of bricks. If the laws that bind molecules together change such that they have a lesser negative charge, then the bridge would melt on a warm day. The Newtonian laws did not change, only the *local* laws changed on the particle level.

It's logical that the laws of particle physics affect everything that exists because everything is made of particles, but that does not make the laws of particle physics *universal* in scope, rather, that which is made of particles is *dependent* on the laws that operate in the *local* particle scope.

#### **Claim 9:** Local laws can alter everything that descends from, or depends on them. 

The State of Order
------------------

It is these laws that create order out of chaos and chaos out of order.

Order exists between the two states of relative chaos, one state tending towards zero energy chaos and the other towards total energy chaos, but even within the chaos we can find clues of order.

One theory that sheds light on new thinking about chaos and order is David Bohm's *Implicate Explicate theory*. In short, Bohm describes this theory by stating:

> In the enfolded \[or implicate\] order, space and time are no longer the dominant factors determining the relationships of dependence or independence of different elements. Rather, an entirely different sort of basic connection of elements is possible, from which our ordinary notions of space and time, along with those of separately existent material particles, are abstracted as forms derived from the deeper order. These ordinary notions, in fact, appear in what is called the “explicate” or “unfolded” order, which is a special and distinguished form contained within the general totality of all the implicate orders “

##### \~Bohm, “Wholeness and the Implicate Order”

To demonstrate this concept, Bohm uses an ink droplet analogy. In this demonstration, he places three drops of ink into a cylinder of glycerin. He then spins the cylinder which “mixes” the ink droplets together. He then reverses the spin and reconstructs the ink drops. When the ink droplets are in their original form, at the beginning and the end of the spinning, they are *explicitly* ink droplets and have the *order* of ink drops. When they are mixed up together, they are *implicitly* ink droplets only, and their order would be considered *chaotic* because there is no order of ink drops. The order of the ink drops has been destroyed, but the information of that order exists as a *virtual* ink-drop within the chaos of their mixed state.<sup>[7](#ref_007)</sup>

In practical terms, this theory says that when something exists in the physical world it is in an *explicit*, or *unfolded* state. To exist in this state, it must conform to a set of rules that define the archetype of the form it will take. When it does not conform to these rules, it still exists, but only in an *implicit* or *enfolded* state, a state we cannot see or interact with (under normal circumstances). This state has its own rules as well but they are a superset of the *explicit* rules, making physical reality as we know it just one sub-state that a *thing* can be in.

It is these local and universal laws that cause form to *unfold,* to *explicate* itself, self-organize, form patterns and move in accordance with these laws. By the same token, these laws will also *enfold* or *implicate* these forms, causing them to return to an unrecognizable state. The laws of existence are constantly moving chaos to order and order to chaos.

Here is another example that perhaps better displays the idea. Below are four identical pages of perfectly random dots, but there are a few dots on each page that have been added. Looking at any one page it would be impossible to detect any pattern. As we merge the pages the randomness gets denser and denser until a pattern of order emerges.

<center><img src="media/007-hidden-random.png" /></center>
The circle is *implicit* in the random dots of each separate page, and *explicit* when the pages line up together in the proper manner.

In this example, the *local* pattern would be the random pattern on each page, which represent the scope, and the *universal* pattern would be the parts of the circle as it exists on every page.

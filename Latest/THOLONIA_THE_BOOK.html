However, when I passed some of these ideas by my friend he followed these arguments all the way to the originating premise from which I claim all structure stems, at which point he firmly rebuked the idea that life has any sort preprogrammed purpose or meaning. His counter argument was simply that one can believe anything they want to believe when it comes to the origins and purpose of reality. He is not alone. It seems that this is a belief that is shared by many nonsectarians, so much so that there are countless new-age belief systems, essentially religions for the secular, that are based on the premise that one&#39;s personal belief systems is the ultimate truth.</span></p><p><span>He and I could agree that neither of us had any claim on the ultimate truth of existence, but he took it further by saying that the manner in which we understand our reality is completely subjective. I had to agree with him on that, but this ignores the issue that this truthful statement was based on a flawed premise.</span></p><p><span>More than simply flawed, it is ultimately fatal, at least to a species or culture that persists in such a belief. The symptoms of a belief system that has no foundation in reality is quite literally a form of madness, and a large portion of modern western society seems to have adopted this belief, or worse, has been taught this belief. Consequently, western culture is suffering from the delusions of this cultural madness, all the while hailing its symptoms as virtues.</span></p><p><span>I won&#39;t say more about these symptoms, but as they will kill its host, we can safely call it a disease.</span></p><p><span>What I am far more interested in is what are the boundaries and structure of reality? If they do exist, then we should be able to identify them in every level of structure, be it atoms, galaxies or society. This is the path of the hard sciences, but even there we see the symptoms of this madness perverting the obvious conclusions of facts, at best, and at worst, denying that facts even exist.</span></p><p><span>In this writing I try and avoid philosophical, social and cultural contexts as much as possible, and where they do exist, I try to keep them at a minimum. This is because this book attempts to transcend the more worldly and exoteric systems. However, the conclusions put forth there can have a dramatic effect on society and culture, as well as science, politics, economics, self-realization, and life itself.</span></p><h1><a name="" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span> </span></h1><div class='md-toc' mdtype='toc'><p class="md-toc-content"><span class="md-toc-item md-toc-h1" data-ref="n1737"><a class="md-toc-inner" style="cursor: pointer;" href="#introduction">INTRODUCTION</a></span><span class="md-toc-item md-toc-h1" data-ref="n1746"><a class="md-toc-inner" style="cursor: pointer;" href="#"> </a></span><span class="md-toc-item md-toc-h1" data-ref="n1749"><a class="md-toc-inner" style="cursor: pointer;" href="#chaos">CHAOS</a></span><span class="md-toc-item md-toc-h6" data-ref="n1750"><a class="md-toc-inner" style="cursor: pointer;" href="#everything-begins-and-ends-in-chaos-so-this-is-a-good-place-to-begin">Everything begins and ends in chaos, so this is a good place to begin.</a></span><span class="md-toc-item md-toc-h2" data-ref="n1770"><a class="md-toc-inner" style="cursor: pointer;" href="#zero">Zero</a></span><span class="md-toc-item md-toc-h4" data-ref="n1780"><a class="md-toc-inner" style="cursor: pointer;" href="#claim-1-chaos-is-a-state-lacking-any-order-time-or-energy-total-nothingness">Claim 1: Chaos is a state lacking any order, time or energy.

name="everything-begins-and-ends-in-chaos-so-this-is-a-good-place-to-begin" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Everything begins and ends in chaos, so this is a good place to begin.</span></h6><p><span>Oxford English Dictionary gives three definitions of the word </span><em><span>chaos</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>These are:</span></p><ul><li><span>The formless matter supposed to have existed before the creation of the universe.</span></li><li><span>The formless and disordered state of matter before the creation of the cosmos</span></li><li><span>A state of extreme confusion and disorder</span></li></ul><p><span>I am not really sure what the difference is between the first two definitions… regardless, we&#39;ll skip over the obvious contradiction of “formless matter” existing before creation… for now.</span></p><p><span>There is also the Ancient Greek mythological definition of the word χάος, </span><em><span>Khaos</span></em><span>, referring to the void state preceding the creation of the universe or cosmos and personified in the Greek creation myths as the god who was “</span><em><span>the first created being, from which came the primeval deities Gaia, Tartarus, Erebus, and Nyx.”</span></em></p><p><span>In physics, chaos is defined as “The property of a complex system whose behavior is so unpredictable as to appear random, owing to great sensitivity to small changes in conditions.”, but as science writer James Gleick points out</span><sup><a href='#1'><span>1</span></a></sup><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>“No one </span><span>[</span><span>of the chaos scientists he interviewed</span><span>]</span><span> could quite agree on </span><span>[</span><span>a definition of</span><span>]</span><span> the word itself, and so instead gives descriptions from a number of practitioners in the field. Those scientists that do have a definition are hardly in agreement, as Philip Holmes defined “chaotic” as, “The complicated aperiodic attracting orbits of certain, usually low-dimensional dynamical systems.” while Bai-Lin Hao describes chaos as “a kind of order without periodicity.”</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Another term for </span><em><span>chaos comes from</span></em><span> cosmology, and that is the </span><em><span>primal void.</span></em></p><p><span>Modern cosmology&#39;s Big Bang theory is quite compatible with this idea that before there was anything, there was nothing but a primal void, a term often used by scientists themselves. The primal void is a descriptive synonym for at least one state of chaos.</span></p><p><span>The primal void has also been called the </span><em><span>gap between heaven and earth</span></em><span>, the </span><em><span>abyss</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>absolute-limitless nothing</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>ex nihilo</span></em><span>, and a number of other terms all trying to convey the idea of total and absolute nothingness, a concept that may well be impossible for the human mind to grasp. This nothingness also includes (or rather, excludes) the concept of time, as there can be no time in a void of nothingness, at least according to Stephen Hawking.</span><sup><a href='#2'><span>2</span></a></sup></p><p><span>Everyone from scientists to mystics seems to agree that before there was something, there was nothing, and then, presto, somethingness appeared in the nothingness.</span></p><p><span>How big is nothingness? Is there a limit to nothingness? If there is, how is that defined? If there is no limit, then is nothingness infinite? There are a lot of sticky questions around the concept of nothingness, which would explain why it&#39;s symbolic representation of the number 0 (zero) is a fairly modern invention.</span></p><h2><a name="zero" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Zero</span></h2><p><span>Zero was first recorded in Mesopotamia around 3 B.C., followed by its appearance in Mesoamerica to the Mayans circa 4 A.D., India in the 5th century, Cambodia in the 7th and China and the Islamic countries in the 8th century. The concept of zero didn&#39;t reach Western Europe until the 12th century, and even then, was not fully accepted as a legitimate number concept for hundreds of years.</span></p><p><span>One of the conceptual challenges of zero is that this single number represents the antithesis of all other numbers. The other conceptual problem is that zero also represents the sum of all numbers! See for yourself… just start adding all numbers together and don&#39;t stop until you get to infinity… (1 + (-1)) + (2 + (-2)) + (3 + (-3)) +... = 0 + 0 + 0 + ... = 0). I am not being hyperbolic here in any way, as this is an ongoing debate in both mathematics and philosophy, and many will claim that, in fact, 0=∞! We&#39;ll let the philosophers figure that out. In the meantime, to deal with the finite world of everyday life we have adopted the practice of simply ignoring the theoretical implications of  − ∞ + ∞=0 and stick to actual things, which are quite finite, and often have no negative equivalents, like the number of cars in Idaho or the number of tomatoes consumed annually.</span></p><p><span>How it applies here is that we have the idea of zero or nothing, and the idea of everything not-zero or not-nothing, which is everything. The idea of zero being the antithesis of all numbers (and possibly the sum of all numbers as well), is equivalent to the equally challenging idea that all that ever did, does or will exist does so only due to the existence of nothingness (and possibly the result of all existence as well). Even just the oxymoronic phrase “the existence of nothingness” may be an conceptual impossibility.</span></p><p><span>Nevertheless, we accept the story, in one form or another, that upon a time, before time even existed, there was an infinite void of nothingness, and then, badda-boom, badda-bing, something appeared in this nothingness… and not just any something, but the totality of all somethingness that has, does, or ever will exist.</span></p><p><span>How many things other than zero are there? In theory, infinite, but in reality, nothing is infinite. Is the somethingness that was created in the nothingness finite or infinite? This was a question that plagued philosophy and science for quite a long time[3] until Einstein came up with a clever answer.</span></p><p><span>According to Einstein&#39;s Field Equations, the universe is not infinite, but rather “finite and unbounded”, which is a clever way to say “infinite, but finite.” Think of the 2D surface of a ball. It is essentially infinite in that you can travel on it forever and never get to the end, but it is bounded, or finite, in that, it only occupies a finite space. The 3D reality that is our Universe is the same, according to Einstein, but like the 3D &#39;surface&#39; of a 4D space.</span></p><p><span>I only mention this to raise the idea that the primal void in which all of existence exists may well be a big 4D ball, rather than an infinite space. True or not, I can&#39;t say, but at least it&#39;s a bit easier to get one&#39;s head around.</span></p><p><span>In either case, the idea of a primal void, or chaos, in mythology as well as cosmology, is one where there is no matter, no energy, no anything.</span></p><p><span>Some colloquial, older definitions of chaos describe it as matter before there was any energy, but as we now know that matter itself is nothing but energy, that description no longer applies.</span></p><h4><a name="claim-1-chaos-is-a-state-lacking-any-order-time-or-energy-total-nothingness" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Claim 1: Chaos is a state lacking any order, time or energy. Total nothingness. </span></h4><p><span>Chaos also has another definition that means exactly the opposite, similar to the ∞ = 0 concept (scientists do that a lot). Take, for example, the study of chaos in the origins of the universe that was undertaken by Chicago&#39;s Northwestern University physicist Adilson Motter, who concluded that 10</span><sup><span>-36</span></sup><span>seconds after the Big Bang happened there was a state of </span><em><span>total chaos</span></em><span>. Do you know what was happening at 10</span><sup><span>-36</span></sup><span> seconds after the Big Bang? Everything, and a temperature of over 1 trillion degrees. Motter concluded from his study:</span></p><blockquote><p><span> “Now we establish once and for all that </span><span>[</span><span>the universe</span><span>]</span><span> is chaotic.”</span></p></blockquote><center><img style="text-align:center" src="../Images/001-bigbang.png"></center><h4><a name="claim-2-chaos-is-a-state-of-total-energy-and-matter-total-somethingness" class="md-header-anchor"></a><strong><span>Claim 2:</span></strong><span> Chaos is a state of total energy and matter.

Both of those states, of total nothingness and total somethingness, have no order, one because it is empty of anything, and the other because it is full of everything in a moment that everything was happening at once. Granted, that total state of chaos after the Big Bang only lasted 10</span><sup><span>-36</span></sup><span> seconds, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that total chaos existed at the birth of the Universe.</span></p><h4><a name="claim-3-chaos-is-a-measure-of-order" class="md-header-anchor"></a><strong><span>Claim 3:</span></strong><span> chaos is a measure of order. </span></h4><h1><a name="energy" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>ENERGY</span></h1><h6><a name="nothing-exists-without-energy-everything-exists-because-of-the-laws-of-energy" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Nothing exists without energy. Everything exists because of the laws of energy.</span></h6><p><span>The topic of energy will be reviewed many times further on, but at this point it&#39;s only important to point out two types of energy; </span><em><span>kinetic</span></em><span> energy, which is the energy capable of causing change to a system as a result of movement, such as water passing through a turbine in a dam, and </span><em><span>potential</span></em><span> energy, which is the energy that is not moving but is available, such as the all the water in the dam that is not passing through the turbine.</span></p><p><span>Where and how the primal energy came from that created our universe is still, and will probably remain, unanswered, at least by modern science. Science, mythology, and religion each have their own stories and theories about it, and, not surprisingly, many of these theories are not that conceptually far apart from each other. One thing we can say about the energy that created this universe (if we are to believe the first law of thermodynamics that states energy cannot be destroyed or created) is that it existed before the Universe was created.</span></p><p><span>For our purpose, at least at this moment, none of these theories or stories matter. What does matter is the idea that once energy was introduced into chaos of the void, something happened. That “something” was some sort of movement, as that is the undebatable nature of energy; it&#39;s always moving. This energy moved in accordance with certain laws. We call these laws the Laws of Physics and the Laws of Nature.</span></p><p><span>The question then becomes, did these laws exist before creation? Did they exist in the chaotic primal void of nothingness? Well, the reasonable answer is yes... and no. “No”, they did not exist in the primal void because these laws only apply where time and space exist, neither of which existed prior to the introduction of energy. “Yes”, in that these laws must have existed “in theory” ... i.e. the relation of a circle to a square existed as a constant (pi), but as there were no circles or squares it was not measurable... there was no </span><em><span>instance</span></em><span> of pi, but there was, for lack of a better word, an archetype of that relationship.</span></p><p><span>The only place where the potential for anything to exist, including concepts, ideas, or archetypes, is in a place where somethingness coexists with nothingness. 0 (which may also equal ∞) can exist, and ∞ (which may also equal 0) can exist, but unless they commingle there will never be numbers. When they do mix numbers appear, and with them, laws. “But!” you may be thinking, “If archetypes can only exist in a duality, and there was not yet a duality before the big bang, how could the archetypes have existed? ” That question is answered a bit later on, but first, we have to address a few other things.</span></p><h2><a name="plato-et-al" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Plato, et al</span></h2><p><span>Without getting too much into philosophy here, the idea of archetypal forms a very Platonic idea.</span></p><p><span>Plato&#39;s </span><em><span>Theory of ideas</span></em><span> is the hypothesis that everything that exists is a material instance of an ideal version, or perfect idea, of that thing.</span></p><p><span>It is also a very Kant-ish idea, and a very Locke-ish, Descartes-ish and Hume-ish idea, for all these great thinkers, plus many more, had the understanding in one form or another </span><em><span>things</span></em><span> were primarily ideas first.  Not all philosophers and scientists-of-old agreed, and in that day the debate usually boiled down to some form of “is there a god?” </span><sup><a href='#143'><span>143</span></a></sup><a name="rev_143">&nbsp;</a><span> Today, science tends to shy away from the concept of a god, but ask equally impossible questions, such as “it reality a hologram?” or “is existence a simulation?”, etc. That question is answered in this book, but the answer is as maddening as it is enlightening, and words like “yes” or “no” become meaningless.</span></p><p><span>For pretty much all of man&#39;s history there has been an archetypal, theoretical, spiritual or mystical concept of a realm of ideas. In this realm, forms, in their unmanifest, uninstantiated state, are simply ideas; the perfect cube, for example, is a concept we all can grasp, but whose instances in the material world can only approach the ideal. These archetypal forms follow archetypal laws, otherwise, the relationship between the area of a circle and its radius could just as well be “elephant toes on Tuesday afternoon”, or “cat dog moo”, or any other randomness.</span></p><p><span>This concept that unmanifest forms are the same as ideas, existing in a non-physical, non-manifest, non-instantiated state, provides a very neat explanation as to origin and nature of the laws of physics. Just as physical forms, like the ball and the cube, have their ideal archetypes, the laws of physics and nature have their archetypal forms as well.</span></p><p><span>The laws of a form and the form itself are not separate things; they are the same thing in two different forms of expression. Form itself is simply a function, or by-product, of the law as it is expressed within the duality of our reality. The form </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> the instantiation of the law. A circle is defined by its law, 2</span><em><span>π**r</span></em><span>, and what we see as a circle is an instance of this law. Laws are the blueprints of archetypes.</span></p><p><span>How do we know that the laws were not derived from the form, rather than the form being derived from the law? This is addressed in more depth further on, but the evidence is that the same laws exist across many forms. One archetype can have many instances, but one instance cannot have many archetypes. This puts the laws of form ‘higher&#39; in the unfolding process of its creation, as the law must exist before the formation or instantiation of the law. This is additionally supported by the idea that the laws themselves are an expression of energy, the ordering force behind all existence, and therefore a prerequisite to form, archetypal or material.</span></p><h4><a name="claim-4-levels-of-order-begin-with-energy-which-has-laws-regarding-how-it-interacts-with-itself-which-form-archetypes-which-have-material-instances" class="md-header-anchor"></a><strong><span>Claim 4:</span></strong><span> Levels of order begin with energy, which has laws regarding how it interacts with itself, which form archetypes, which have material instances. </span></h4><p><span>You may be asking “OK, but what if Plato and the gang were wrong?”, but this is not a relevant question because that question assumes that we have access to, or can even grasp, the “ultimate truth” if one even exists.

For the record, Aristotle rejected Plato&#39;s ideas of forms and stated that all things can only come into existence via matter. From the perspective of this book, both can be true, as one deals with the world of archetypes and ideas and the other strictly with materialism. In both cases of </span><em><span>form</span></em><span> and the </span><em><span>laws of form,</span></em><span> there is one concept that simply expresses itself relative to the context of its scope of either ideas or matter.</span></p><p><span>Although today we tend to think of Plato&#39;s Theory of Ideas as an abstraction, Plato was quite clear that this realm was as real as the realm we exist in every day, the difference being in the material realm we can never know the true form or idea due to the limitations of material reality. In Plato&#39;s </span><em><span>Allegory of the Cave,</span></em><span> he describes this reality as limited due to the fact that it is no more than a mere shadow and echo of the true reality (of ideas).

We have, Coulomb&#39;s Law, Stefan&#39;s Law, Pascal&#39;s Law, Hooke&#39;s Law, Bernoulli&#39;s Principle, Boyles&#39;s Law, Charles&#39;s Law, Kepler&#39;s Law, Law of conservation of energy, the Tyndall effect, Graham&#39;s Law, Newton&#39;s Three Laws of motion, Ohm&#39;s Law, and many more.</span></p><p><span>One of these universal laws is </span><em><span>energy will always follow the path of least resistance. This is called entropy</span></em><span> and explains why water runs downhill to form rivers, electrons always seek a positive charge, resulting in electricity, high pressure seeks low pressure, and why stuff breaks.</span></p><p><span>A simple analogy would be to compare entropy to water in lakes, rivers, and the sea. Only the water that is above the sea level can be used to do work (e.g. move a water wheel). Entropy represents the water that is at or below sea level and therefore unusable for work.</span></p><p><span>This is also how batteries work. A charged battery has low entropy (high usable energy), and a dead battery has high entropy (no usable energy). A dead battery still has all the energy it had before, but it is no longer usable because the energy, in the form of electrons, has moved from the positive side of the battery to the negative side until it achieved balance and there were no more electrons left on the positive side of the battery that were compelled by the laws of balance to move… but they are still in the battery, and still acting like electrons.</span></p><p><span>This is classical physics, and entropy in classical physics is defined as </span><em><span>disorder</span></em><span> because, without the flow of energy, there is no order. For the record, entropy is a fairly complex process that not everyone agrees on, so, we&#39;re really using ‘high-altitude&#39; definitions here.</span></p><p><span>In the water example, if we have two identical bodies of water, one 100 feet above the other, we say that the upper body of water has lower entropy than the lower body of water, and the lower body of water has higher entropy than the upper body of water, but there is no difference between these two bodies of water when compared independently. The difference only appears when compared to each other, because one is higher than the other. We can say that both bodies are in a (slightly) higher state of chaos when they are not connected. Once they are connected, and the water begins to flow, there is movement of energy, and order follows.</span></p><p><span>This is what is theoretically happening to the universe right now because according to the Big Bang Theory, there was zero entropy (total energy) at the moment of the Big Bang. Since then all that energy has been following the path of least resistance as it moves into the surrounding nothingness, like water into the ocean or electrons in a battery, raising the entropy of the universe and decreasing the amount of useable energy. This is why, according to the theory, the universe will end up in a state of chaos and disorder, like a dead battery or a stagnant lake. The Universe started in chaos and will end in chaos, and in-between those two points, there is the movement of energy, which creates order.</span></p><h4><a name="claim-11-order-and-pattern-requires-energy" class="md-header-anchor"></a><strong><span>Claim 11:</span></strong><span> Order and pattern requires energy. </span></h4><p><span>One interesting takeaway from this understanding is that interconnectivity allows for movement of energy. This movement creates order. Therefore the idea that everything is connected is not simply a philosophical abstract concept, but a necessity for order.</span></p><p><span>In other areas of study, the definition of entropy carries the same idea of disorder or chaos but is used in a narrower context, so it sounds confusing unless you are familiar with that context. For example:</span></p><ul><li><strong><span>In probability theory</span></strong><span>, the entropy of a random variable is the measure of uncertainty.</span></li><li><strong><span>In information theory</span></strong><span>, the </span><em><span>compression entropy</span></em><span> of a compressed file, like a zipped file or a JPEG image, measures the amount of information loss.</span></li><li><strong><span>In sociology</span></strong><span>, entropy is the natural decay of a society&#39;s structure (such as law, organization, convention, ethics, etc.).</span></li></ul><p><span>For our purposes, we will simply use the classical definition of entropy as a </span><em><span>measure of disorder</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>Another law to look at is Newton&#39;s First Law, the Law of Inertia, which states “an object will remain at rest or move at a constant speed in a straight line unless it is acted upon by an unbalanced force.” This is why things don&#39;t fly around randomly on their own for no reason.</span></p><p><span>These are just two of the many laws that determine how our reality works, at least within the scope of the reality we tend to deal with. On the quantum and galactic levels, or super high or low energy states, things may operate a bit differently.</span></p><p><span>These laws always ensure that everything will operate at its most efficient level. What does “operate” even mean? It means the optimal movement of energy. As energy only moves when there is a difference between two states, the movement of energy is meant to do only one thing, and that is to neutralize that difference by creating a balance between two conditions that are not the same, whether it&#39;s the conditions of somethingness and nothingness or just a few degrees of temperature. Once balance is achieved the movement stops. A balanced battery is a battery at peace with itself… and it is also a dead battery.</span></p><p><span>The optimum condition for the movement of energy between two states is one that operates within the limitations and abilities of both of those conditions.</span></p><p><span>A beautiful example of entropy and inertia that works today as much as it did thousands of years ago can be easily demonstrated with something called the </span><em><span>harmonograph</span></em><span>. This is a fascinating and entertaining device that takes an initial push (low entropy) and then draws a two-dimensional design on a blank paper as that initial energy slowly diminishes (inertia), until it stops (high entropy).</span><sup><a href='#8'><span>8</span></a></sup></p><center><img src="../Images/008-harmonograph.jpg" style="width:5.5in;height:3.60833in" alt="Harmonograph"></center><h4><a name="claim-12-everything-is-in-a-state-of-seeking-andor-maintaining-balance" class="md-header-anchor"></a><strong><span>Claim 12:</span></strong><span> Everything is in a state of seeking and/or maintaining balance. </span></h4><h2><a name="oscillation" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Oscillation</span></h2><p><span>One law, or pattern, that can be seen in every part of the universe, is that everything oscillates.</span></p><p><span>Oscillation is how energy sustains movement between two states, which supports the definition that “chaos is a kind of order without periodicity” for without oscillation or periodicity, there is less order and more chaos.</span></p><p><span>Everything that is sustainable (i.e. currently exists), from the atoms to the galaxies, oscillates in some fashion and has some kind of frequency(s).</span></p><blockquote><p><span>“All things have a frequency and a vibration.”</span></p></blockquote><h5><a name="nikola-tesla" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>~</span><span>Nikola Tesla</span></h5><p><img src="../Images/009-planet-spiral.png" style="float:left;width:1.55347in;height:1.41042in" /><span>We typically think of light waves and sound waves as the classical example of oscillations, but the heavenly bodies and stars in the sky are also oscillating particles on a cosmic scale.

Contrary to the statement “lightning never strikes the same place twice”, lighting often strikes the same place many times, and for good reason. Ben Franklin suspected why, which gave birth to the lightning rod, saving millions of building from burning to the ground. </span></p><p><span>We know that energy always travels the path of least resistance, so we can say that the path between some point in the sky and the tip of the lightning rod is the path of least resistance, and we can say that this path was predetermined before the electrons traveled it. When electrons build up in the sky and then jump to earth as they balance the change, they are not heading out on a journey looking for a place to land. They already ‘know’ where they are going to land because the destination of their journey must be known before they can begin to move. This path could be described as a low-resistance path to the ground or fields of resistance and potential, and probably a few other attributes, but the point to remember is that the path is defined and known before it is traveled. </span></p><p><span>Using the water metaphor, we can say that water will always seek the lowest point.  There are many paths between the top of a mountain and the valley, but the water will only travel down the lowest paths.

(Maybe that&#39;s why we can&#39;t break the speed of light because if we did, we&#39;d ‘blow a cosmic fuse&#39; and shut down reality!

In the world of electricity, voltage is described as </span><em><span>electric pressure</span></em><span> that results from the difference that exists between two states, one being the highest potential energy, and the other being the lowest potential energy. Can we then say that these missing cosmic volts ((let&#39;s call them </span><em><span>zvolts</span></em><span>, for lack of a better term) represent the difference between two opposing states? What these states might be is up for grabs. Perhaps low entropy (order) and high entropy (chaos)? Whatever zvolts are, given that they are values that measure the difference between two points that are quite fundamental to our reality, they might be very significant in understanding reality in terms of dualities.</span></p><p><span>We can calculate for these missing zvolts by applying the simple formula:</span></p><p><em><span>Voltage (V) = Current (I) </span><span>*</span><span> Resistance (R)</span></em></p><p><span>which equates to </span><em><span>zvolts (z) = Speed of Light (c) </span><span>*</span><span> Mass (m)</span></em></p><p><span>This then becomes (using the ISU standard[10] units of measure) </span><em><span>300,000,000 km/sec </span><span>*</span><span> 1 kg = 300,000,000 zvolts.</span></em></p><p><span>So zvolts is the same as </span><em><span>c</span></em><span>?

Reality itself, as defined by Relativity? The value of zvolts are always proportional (by </span><em><span>c</span></em><span>) to the value of mass, and they determine the size of the energy field. As everything that exists can be described using </span><em><span>E=mc</span><sup><span>2</span></sup><span>,</span></em><span> this would imply that everything that exists has a zvolt field, and as zvolts measure to greatest difference between two opposing potentials, are zvolts one measure of the duality a thing exists within?</span></p><p><span>It&#39;s all quite fertile ground for speculation, at least to someone like myself who is too uneducated to know the thousands of reasons why speculation is pointless.</span></p><p><span>Getting back to these twelve formulas… we think about voltage, resistance, and current (or energy and mass) as separate things, similar to how we think about time and space as two different things. However, space and time are two parts of one larger thing called </span><em><span>space-time</span></em><span>. Likewise, voltage, current, and resistance are three aspects of one type of energy, electricity. Frequency, wavelength, and velocity are three aspects of another thing, such as radiation. All areas where this law applies are themselves different aspects, or parts, of an even larger expression of energy.</span></p><p><span>Here we are using Ohm&#39;s Law to show how one law can be expressed across many scopes, but this same reasoning applies to all natural laws in physics, or elsewhere.</span></p><h2><a name="alchemy" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Alchemy</span></h2><p><span>If we are claiming that these laws can be seen throughout our evolution of discovery, we should be able to see them in the early forms of science, alchemy.</span></p><p><span>Alchemy is the birthplace of modern science, Despite the charlatans of science of their days, just like today, many alchemists profited by promising their &quot;elixirs of life&quot; and promises of discovering the &quot;philosophers stone.&quot; The goal of alchemy was to discover the secrets of nature, and to alchemists, this was a much a spiritual journey as it was a technical one.  Modern science has done away with the spiritual or mystical aspect of knowledge and doubled down on the technical aspects, which is an unsustainable position.    </span></p><p><span>I propose that we can, specifically in the concept of the elements of earth, water, air, and fire.    These elements do not refer to the material instances but to their archetypes of which the material forms are limited instances of.  The first form of matter that came into existence,  which would be the equivalent of modern science&#39;s atomic-sized ball of everything that exploded to fill the universe, was considered to be formed by these four archetypes.  This was an idea held by the ancient Greeks, the Islamic philosophers and scientists, Asians and Europeans.</span></p><p><span>As archetypes, they did not only instantiate as matter but also qualities. For example, the elements were used do describe health as far back as Hippocrates (400 BC), and as recently as Carl Jung&#39;s theory of personality, which drew heavily of Hippocrates.  In Jung&#39;s theory, there were four types of personalities:  feeling (fire, choleric), thinking (water, phlegmatic), intuition (air, sanguine), and sensation (earth, melancholic).  He then added other attributes such as introversion/extroversion, to come up with eight basic personality archetypes.</span></p><p><span>How this is relevant here is that the four alchemical elements are a very early version of the four qualities of matter as expressed by Newton&#39;s 2nd law?</span></p><p><span>What we understand as resistance, current, volts, and power today, the alchemists understood as instances of earth, fire, air, and water archetypes,  respectively.  This is not to suggest that just as </span><em><span>V=IxR</span></em><span>, so too does </span><em><span>air = fire x earth</span></em><span>.  This is simply an example of how the same patterns and archetypes keep appearing across many contexts and scopes, such as technology, science, mysticism, social order, biology, and many, many more.</span></p><center><img src="../Images/115-elements.png"></center><h4><a name="claim-15-instances-of-laws-are-limited-defined-and-understood-according-to-their-context" class="md-header-anchor"></a><strong><span>Claim 15:</span></strong><span> Instances of laws are limited, defined and understood according to their context. </span></h4><h2><a name="redundancy" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Redundancy</span></h2><p><span>The oscillation constant also gives us a glimpse into another basic, yet profound property of creation and reality, and that is its self-similar redundancy. </span><em><span>Self-similar redundancy</span></em><span> (a term that is itself redundant) is how one property or law manifests itself across different orders of scale in the most effective manner given the context, state, and scope of that order.</span></p><p><span>One of the more obvious examples of this type of self-similarity, besides the water/electricity examples above, might be the commonality between the structure of a solar system and the structure of an atom.</span></p><p><span>Of course, we need to consider that at the quantum level the instance of a centric system, like an atom, would be constrained by the local laws of quantum mechanics, such as electromagnetism, electron energy levels, the nuclear weak force, etc., while in a much larger system, like a solar system, the same laws would be constrained by the local laws of momentum, gravity, and Newtonian physics.</span></p><p><span>Many scientists will tell you there is no relationship between atoms and solar systems, and that this analogy depends on an old and outdated concept of the atom.

Salthe, Professor Emeritus, Brooklyn College of the City University of New York, who said:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>“It is an interesting possibility that the ‘power laws&#39;</span><sup><span>6</span></sup><span> followed by so many different kinds of systems might be the result of downward constraints exerted by encompassing supersystems.”</span></p></blockquote><h5><a name="-stanley-n-salthe&nbsp;entropy&nbsp;2004&nbsp;6-335" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>~</span><span> Stanley N.

These foundations are rather simple and easily comprehensible. The major foundation evolves like a seed into more complicated levels of the structure, such that after a series of steps a structure results that appears like the structure of the physical reality that humans can partly observe.” </span><sup><a href='#14'><span>14</span></a></sup></p></blockquote><h5><a name="-the-structure-of-physical-reality" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>~</span><span> The Structure of Physical Reality</span></h5><p><span>He then goes on to say...</span></p><blockquote><p><span>“The </span><span>[</span><span>paper &#39;The Structure of Physical Reality&#39;</span><span>]</span><span> applies the name </span><em><span>physical reality</span></em><span> to comprise the universe with everything that exists and moves therein. It does not matter whether the aspects of this reality are observable. It is even plausible that a large part of this reality is not in any way perceptible. The part that is observable shows at the same time an enormous complexity, and yet it demonstrates a peculiarly large coherence.</span></p><p><span>The conclusion is that physical reality clearly has a structure. Moreover, this structure has a hierarchy. Higher layers are becoming more complicated. That means immediately that a dive into the deeper layers reveals an increasingly simpler structure. Eventually, we come to the foundation, and that structure must be easily understandable. The way back to higher structure layers delivers an interesting prospect. The foundation must force the development of reality in a predetermined direction. The document postulates that the evolution of reality resembles the evolution of a seed from which only a specific type of plant can grow. The growth process provides stringent restrictions so that only this type of plant can develop. This similarity, therefore, means that the fundamentals of physical reality can only develop the reality that we know”</span></p></blockquote><p><span>In other words, he is saying that there are orders of creation (</span><em><span>hierarchy</span></em><span> and </span><em><span>layers</span></em><span>, in his words) that must abide by specific laws and which are limited (</span><em><span>predetermined</span></em><span>) by their component parts (</span><em><span>seeds</span></em><span>).

I say “apparent” because I don&#39;t want to suggest that there is disorder in a seed and order in the resulting flower.

Data is the static byproduct of the movement of.</span></p><h4><a name="claim-30-data-exists-only-in-a-duality" class="md-header-anchor"></a><strong><span>Claim 30:</span></strong><span> Data exists only in a duality. </span></h4><p><span>In its most basic form, data is numbers, words, units of measure, and other conceptual abstractions we invented to describe the phenomena within the spectrum of existence we can perceive and use.</span></p><p><span>If we accept the premise that everything that exists does so within the laws of creation, then we also need to accept that nothing exists that is not in perfect harmony with these laws because if they were not in perfect harmony with the laws they would not exist. Therefore, everything that can exist does, and everything that cannot exist does not. If that is true, then it is also true that all data is as valid as existence, as data is only a byproduct of existence.</span></p><h4><a name="claim-31-data-is-the-byproduct-of-existence-that-we-represent-with-conceptual-abstractions" class="md-header-anchor"></a><strong><span>Claim 31:</span></strong><span> Data is the byproduct of existence that we represent with conceptual abstractions. </span></h4><h4><a name="claim-32-all-data-is-valid" class="md-header-anchor"></a><strong><span>Claim 32:</span></strong><span> All data is valid</span></h4><p><span>What, then, is information? The classic and simplest definition is “data that we can use to understand something”, which is just another way of saying “Information is data that has meaning”?</span></p><h3><a name="understanding" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Understanding</span></h3><p><span>This raises the question </span><em><span>“What is understanding? ”</span></em><span> Again, the traditional meaning is </span><em><span>“the knowledge of why or how something happens or works.”</span></em><span> This is pretty unsatisfactory, and quite arguably wrong. At the risk of sounding Clintonesque here, debating what the definition of ‘is&#39; is, the words </span><em><span>“use”</span></em><span> and </span><em><span>“understand”</span></em><span> are completely subjective and offer no real definition, and with the word </span><em><span>work</span></em><span> defined as simply </span><em><span>“to function or operate according to design”</span></em><span>, this entire definition is vague, as best.</span></p><p><span>Can we come up with a better definition of the words </span><em><span>knowledge</span></em><span> and </span><em><span>understanding</span></em><span>?</span></p><p><span>To know something&#39;s function and purpose is the fundamental goal of the science, philosophy and even religion, as these disciplines require a demonstrative understanding which we can see in their relative forms of reasoning.</span></p><p><span>Like in the previous dancing-woman-in-the-dots example above, we can perceive something that is little more than projection and has no basis in reality. In fact, it is this human ability to ‘recognize&#39; things in meaningless images that brought about the famous Rorschach inkblot test as it seemed to be a good way to see how a person perceived the world by seeing what patterns they projected onto the random images.</span></p><p><span>In the world of philosophy, this knowledge-as-projection is called the </span><em><span>cow in the field problem</span></em><span> first posed by American philosopher Edmund Gettier. It goes like this:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>A farmer is concerned his prize cow has gotten lost. A neighbor comes to the farmer and tells him he saw the cow in his field. Just to double-check. the farmer visits the neighbor&#39;s field and sees the familiar black and white shape of his cow. Satisfied, he goes home. The neighbor also decided to check. The cow is in the field, but it&#39;s hidden behind some large bushes. Caught in the bushes, however, is a large sheet of black and white paper. It is clear that the farmer saw this and thought it was his cow. The question is then: even though the cow was in the field, was the farmer correct when he said he knew it was there?</span></p></blockquote><p><span>This was meant as a criticism of the popular definition of </span><em><span>knowledge</span></em><span> as </span><em><span>justified true belief</span></em><span>, meaning, if you believe something and it is both factually true and verifiable, then that is </span><em><span>knowledge</span></em><span>. This is a terribly misguided post-modern idea of knowledge, in my humble opinion, because by this definition the dancing-woman-in-the-dots </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> knowledge, as it satisfies all three conditions. By this definition, </span><em><span>understanding</span></em><span> is vulnerable to this same human trait of subjectivity, which is wildly reliable, as best.</span></p><p><span>Simply </span><em><span>knowing</span></em><span> the details of a situation is not the same as </span><em><span>understanding</span></em><span> them. We can see this in the countless cases of confusing or challenging situations that demand critical decisions that inevitably fall prey to our conscious or unconscious beliefs, desires, and fears. We can see this difference even in less dramatic situations, such as the knowing all the details about camping, and actually camping. It&#39;s the difference between the map and the terrain.</span></p><p><span>Therefore, a better definition of understanding might be “the knowledge of something sufficient enough to be able to make verifiably accurate statements regarding said thing.”</span></p><h3><a name="verification" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Verification</span></h3><p><span>But this too falls short depending on what </span><em><span>verifiable</span></em><span> means. For example, four people have to solve the following puzzle…</span></p><p><span>What is the next number in this sequence? 91715</span></p><p><span>Bob says “1”, and Carol says “3”. Bob defends his answer by showing the obvious, that 71 is 20 less than 91, therefore 51, being 20 less than 71, is the obvious pattern. Carol, however, says is it 3 because 917153 is, in fact, a sequence of numbers in Pi. Ted also says “1” but because 9+1=10, 7+1=8, therefore 5+</span><em><span>x</span></em><span> = 6, so </span><em><span>x</span></em><span> must be 1. Alice says “9” because that would result in three prime numbers 11, 13, and 17 using the 2D lattice she made to solve the problem.</span></p><p><span>All four people have an understanding of the problem and the ways in which it can be solved, and therefore all four answers are verifiable. It&#39;s not unlike when you ask a child what is 1+1, and she confidently answers “6”. When asked why 1+1 = 6 she says: </span><em><span>“I had one white cat and one gray cat, now I have 6 cats; 2 white cats, two gray cats, a black cat and a cat that is all colors”</span></em><span> referring to her two cats and their 4 new kittens. Not only did 1+1 equal 6, but it came in many colors.</span></p><p><span>As silly as this sounds, her answer was quite accurate given the context of </span><em><span>“1 (female cat) + 1(male cat)”</span></em><span>, which is not at all an irrelevant detail, especially to the cats. We can see the ‘error&#39; here as the child not being able to properly identify the differences between the overlapping contexts of math and animals. We should not be quick to judge this child because we have to assume that even the greatest thinkers will make the same ‘error&#39;, albeit with more complex contexts, because this discernment is a product of our neurology, the brain being a big pattern recognition machine. Unless we have the ultimate brain, we can&#39;t recognize everything.</span></p><p><span>Understanding is contextual and only relevant to the degree that it applies to the matter in question and why the question was asked in the first place. Even the concept of ‘1&#39; is contextually relevant. We may have 1 dollar or 1 day, but what does 1 mean if we say we have 1 puddle plus 1 puddle? We either have 2 puddles, or, if they are connected, we have a 1 big puddle, and now ‘2&#39; is the not the unit count of puddles, but the relative volume of the puddle, i.e. 1 puddle that is 2 times as large. If we drop 1 rock into a lake, we have 1 wave function. If we drop 2 rocks in a lake we have 2 wave functions, but in this case,1 = Acos(</span><em><span>k**x</span></em><span>−</span><em><span>ω**t</span></em><span>+</span><em><span>φ</span></em><span>) and 2 is equivalent to </span><em><span>W</span></em><span>2(</span><em><span>x</span></em><span>,</span><em><span>t</span></em><span>) = </span><em><span>A</span><strong><span>c</span></strong><span>o**s</span></em><span>(</span><em><span>k**x</span></em><span>−</span><em><span>ω**t</span></em><span>+</span><em><span>φ</span></em><span>), **as that is what happens when 2 waves interfere with each other. “This makes sense”, you may be thinking, but what happens if we take 1 particle traveling at </span><em><span>x</span></em><span> speed, and smash it headfirst into another particle traveling at </span><em><span>x</span></em><span> speed? You might think that the particles smash into each other at the speed of </span><em><span>2x</span></em><span>, but you&#39;d be wrong if </span><em><span>x</span></em><span> was the speed of light, because, at the speed of light 1+1 = 1 in his case, at least according to the Theory of Relativity.</span><sup><a href='#33'><span>33</span></a></sup></p><p><span>So, let&#39;s modify the meaning of understanding to “the knowledge of something sufficient enough to be able to make verifiably accurate statements regarding said thing within the context of its current application”.</span></p><h4><a name="claim-33-understanding-is-the-knowledge-of-something-sufficient-enough-to-be-able-to-make-verifiably-accurate-statements-regarding-said-thing-within-the-context-of-its-current-application" class="md-header-anchor"></a><strong><span>Claim 33:</span></strong><span> Understanding is “the knowledge of something sufficient enough to be able to make verifiably accurate statements regarding said thing within the context of its current application.”</span></h4><p><span>With this definition, Bob, Carol, Ted and Alice can all make statements based on their understanding, but none of them are verifiable unless we know why the question was asked. If the point was to see if they had reasoning abilities, they are all right, and so was the little girl, according to their relative reasoning abilities, and the specific question itself is irrelevant as any number of questions could be asked to get the same results. If the point of the question was to try and recover the last digit of a telephone number, there&#39;s a 10% change any one answer is correct, including the little girl&#39;s answer, and the question was still meaningless.</span></p><p><span>We can now answer the question “How do we define </span><em><span>information</span></em><span>?” In light of the fact that if all data is valid and is therefore potentially information that is merely undiscovered due to our limited understanding of its relevance to context, </span><em><span>information</span></em><span> now can be defined as “</span><em><span>relevant data that we know how, when and where to apply given our understanding of the applicable context.”</span></em><span> In short, information is </span><em><span>relevant data</span></em><span>.</span></p><h4><a name="claim-34-information-is-relevant-data-that-we-know-how-when-and-where-to-apply-given-our-understanding-of-the-applicable-context" class="md-header-anchor"></a><strong><span>Claim 34:</span></strong><span> Information is “relevant data that we know how, when and where to apply given our understanding of the applicable context.”</span></h4><h2><a name="data-to-information" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Data to Information</span></h2><p><span>Data, being an abstract byproduct of everything, is, by itself, meaningless, just as the existence of matter is, by itself, meaningless.

How do all these </span><em><span>understandings</span></em><span> we have discovered relate to one another?</span></p><p><span>Attempting to answer this question is what gave rise to the entire field of Western philosophy. In fact, the word </span><em><span>philosophy</span></em><span>, which literally means “love of wisdom”, was invented 2,600 years ago by the Greek mathematician, philosopher and religious mystic, Pythagoras, as the field of study dedicated to understanding how reality is put together. A few years later, Parmenides, perhaps the most profound and challenging thinker of the Greek philosophers, came up with the idea of categorizing all that was understood about existence. Today this is called </span><em><span>ontology</span></em><span>, which is hierarchical in nature and comes from the Greek “the study of that which is.”</span></p><h4><a name="claim-34-all-information-is-hierarchical" class="md-header-anchor"></a><strong><span>Claim 34:</span></strong><span> All information is hierarchical. </span></h4><p><span>Needless to say, there has been a lot of discussing, researching and testing over the past thousands of years on the best way to organize “that which is.”</span></p><h2><a name="holarchies" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Holarchies</span></h2><p><span>In 1972 Ervin Laszlo, philosopher, theorist and two-time Nobel Prize nominee, published “Evolutionary Systems Theory. Introduction to Systems Philosophy: Toward a New Paradigm of Contemporary Thought.”</span><sup><a href='#34'><span>34</span></a></sup><span>In that book, he incorporates Living Systems Theory and the hierarchical structures of Mario Bunge, a giant in the field of semantics, ontology, epistemology, philosophy of science and ethics, and recipient of twenty-one honorary doctorates and four honorary professorships by universities from both the Americas and Europe.</span></p><p><span>Laszlo&#39;s challenge was to provide a framework for understanding universal structures that span the scopes of subatomic physics, through biology, chemistry, organisms, and social systems to the cosmos. Laszlo describes a hierarchical model of interconnected conceptual entities. When one of these entities is acting as a </span><em><span>part</span></em><span> of a larger entity, it is called a </span><em><span>parton</span></em><span>, and when acting as a </span><em><span>whole</span></em><span> entity with its own parts, or </span><em><span>partons</span></em><span>, it is called a </span><em><span>holon</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>The </span><em><span>holon</span></em><span> represents the </span><em><span>wholeness of its nature</span></em><span>, and the </span><em><span>parton</span></em><span> representing the integrated </span><em><span>part</span></em><span> of the greater </span><em><span>holon</span></em><span>. The hierarchical ordering of </span><em><span>holon/patrons</span></em><span> is called a </span><em><span>holarchy</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>In the previous example of the cell, the cell itself would be a </span><em><span>holon</span></em><span>, and the transcoder, the barrel-shaped tubes, and other components would be </span><em><span>partons</span></em><span> of the cell. Likewise, the transcoder is a </span><em><span>holon</span></em><span> with its component </span><em><span>partons</span></em><span>, and the cell itself is a </span><em><span>parton</span></em><span> to, say, an organ. This makes the holarchy somewhat fractal in nature as the structure of the entire hierarchy is self-replicated in each of the holons.</span></p><h4><a name="claim-36-all-information-is-fractal-or-self-similar-or-redundant" class="md-header-anchor"></a><strong><span>Claim 36:</span></strong><span> All information is fractal, or self-similar, or redundant. </span></h4><p><span>The holarchy is a map of all the concepts of archetypes we have collected and attempts to organize these concepts in a hierarchical fashion. As each parton in a child of a holon, it naturally inherits the scope of its parent. It is these scopes that define the order. Each holon has a unique scope, and this scope is what defines the spectrum of possibilities, the Bell curve of probability, for any particular holon. For example, within the holon of </span><em><span>person,</span></em><span> you will only find </span><em><span>person</span></em><span> things and not </span><em><span>planet</span></em><span> things.</span></p><center><img src="../Images/029-holarchy.png" style="width:90%"></center><p><span>The graphs above represent a very small subsection of the Grand Holarchy of Everything. The left shows how partons and holons relate to one another. The right shows one of the many paths that connects subatomic particles to the multiverse.</span></p><p><span>With a few tweaks to the previous </span><em><span>Super-Duper Graph of Reality</span></em><span> Bell curve, making the right axis more logarithmic rather than linear, this model fits nicely on top of it.</span></p><center><img src="../Images/030-supercurve2.png" style="width:90%" alt="Bell-Curve2.png"></center><p><span>Some readers may be thinking “Hey, wait a minute… those aren&#39;t the same axis! What kind of Gaussian goofiness in going on here?” Well, that is partly true. The first Super-Duper Graph of Reality chart shows the probability (x-axis) of where order (y-axis) will be more likely to emerge across the entire spectrum of existence while this one is limited to the spectrum of human perception.</span></p><p><span>If we assume that our perceptions of reality are fairly compatible with reality as it actually exists, then, as probability would have it, we humans happen to be in the part of the spectrum where one would most expect to find life popping up, so, congratulations to us, we&#39;re where we are supposed to be... probably.</span></p><p><span>Because the peak of the curve represents where the most “work” will be done (given the two poles that define the limits of the curve), it is also where energy will most likely be able to form patterns. The peak of the curve also represents the most efficient expression of a holon&#39;s purpose and function. If we were electrons instead of humans, our archetypal holon would have the electron in the center, because, as the electron </span><em><span>does</span></em><span> exist, it would naturally occupy that point where its existence is most likely... in the peak of the curve for the electron holon. However, because life forms exist in the peak of the curve from that spans from quark to multiverse, we can speculate that life itself is the primary function of reality and that the consciousness that comes with life being the highest form of expression of life. This is not to say that there are no other forms of life that may excel in this regard, but if there are other forms of life, they will appear within the same range of the curve.</span></p><p><span>For consistency, here is the human eye sensitivity chart as well with the new y-axis and its shading, which represent a singular holon of </span><em><span>human eye</span></em><span> in the </span><em><span>bio</span></em><span> branch of the hierarchy.</span></p><center><img src="../Images/031-eyecurve2.png" style="width:90%" alt="eye-Bell-Curve.png"></center><h4><a name="claim-37-each-holon-has-its-own-set-of-parameters-laws-and-context-and-each-holon-has-the-ability-to-spawn-new-holons" class="md-header-anchor"></a><strong><span>Claim 37:</span></strong><span> Each holon has its own set of parameters, laws, and context and each holon has the ability to spawn new holons. </span></h4><h4><a name="claim-38-holons-or-archetypes-are-interdependent-on-one-another" class="md-header-anchor"></a><strong><span>Claim 38:</span></strong><span> Holons, or archetypes, are interdependent on one another</span></h4><h2><a name="memes" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Memes</span></h2><p><span>More recently, this holarchical model was applied to Richard Dawkins concept of a </span><em><span>meme</span></em><sup><a href='#35'><span>35</span></a></sup><span>.

It is interesting because it defines a meme as a seventh-generation descendant component part, a particle, so to speak, of the </span><em><span>uber</span></em><span> concept of </span><em><span>culture</span></em><span>. The meme here is analogous to what the electron is to the atom, or the atom to the molecule, or the molecule to the object. He also puts </span><em><span>ideas</span></em><span> down there as well, which may be consistent with the way he is defining an idea. In our case, we are defining </span><em><span>Ideas</span></em><span> (capital ‘I&#39;), like forms, as the archetypal blueprint for many instances of ideas. The idea of </span><em><span>“let&#39;s make a video game where people have to shoot each other”</span></em><span> is an instance of the Idea </span><em><span>“Individual or tribal competition and survival”</span></em><span>, which also spawns such concepts as sports, war, capitalism, the idea of winning, etc. The idea of </span><em><span>“if I sin, I will burn in hell”</span></em><span>, a very resilient and popular meme for thousands of years, is an instance of the Idea </span><em><span>“we are judged harshly by our superiors for being self-serving”</span></em><span>, which spawn such concepts as karma, judgment day, guilt, original sin, etc.</span></p><p><img src="../Images/033-embeddedholons.png" style="float:right;width:0.99167in;height:1.02778in" /><span>The holarchy examples shown above is portrayed as being a 2-dimensional bifurcating tree, but this model hides a lot of information, for if we zoomed in, we would see that within each holon is a collection of holons that share an idea, purpose, function, etc.</span></p><p><span>Each holon has its parameters, laws, context, etc., and each holon, therefore, has its own Bell chart that shows where it is best suited to “work”, such as the Bell chart of the human eye sensitivity, which would be one holon of “human eye”.</span></p><p><span>These bell curves of probability are not shown, or even defined, in the holarchic model. The reason for that is because the holarchic model does not have the concept of a duality. As a result, the holarchy cannot show how the Bell curve of a holon is made up of the integrated aggregate of the Bell curves of its partons, but within the context of the holon. It does show the parameters of the holon are defined by its parent, but the ultimate parent of the holon is the Multiverse, which is, in our view, the ‘bottom&#39; of the hierarchy, as reality as we know it requires there first exists subatomic particles. In some way, this is like arguing which is the “correct” way to view the earth, but it does play an important role a little later.</span></p><p><span>What happens if we model the duality of </span><em><span>total nothingness</span></em><span> and </span><em><span>total somethingness</span></em><span> with the holarchy?</span></p><h1><a name="reason" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>REASON</span></h1><h6><a name="the-ability-to-understand-something-is-limited-by-our-ability-to-perceive-something-as-our-perception-changes-so-does-our-understanding-change-and-with-that-the-reasoning-we-apply" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>The ability to understand something is limited by our ability to perceive something. As our perception changes, so does our understanding change, and with that, the reasoning we apply.</span></h6><p><span>We arrived at these laws through reason, and we humans are rather proud of that claim as we like to believe we invented reason, but we didn&#39;t. We did discover it, however, so at least we can take credit for being doggedly curious.</span></p><p><em><span>Reason</span></em><span> is what we call our ability to recognize the natural processes that arise from the patterns of creation and is the product of intellectual survival, a skill we evolved to give us fang-less, claw-less, slow, small and tasty humans a fighting chance in the Darwinian battlefield.</span></p><p><span>To be fair, there has been a long-standing debate over whether mathematics, and by association, reason, was invented or discovered. One of the more solid debates is presented by leading astrophysicist Mario Livio in his article “Why Math</span>
<span>Works”</span><sup><a href='#16'><span>16</span></a></sup></p><p><span>In that article, he refers to those who believe math was discovered as Platonists, due to the fact that Platonic archetypes include math archetypes, as math is a form of an idea. Livio gets into the idea that math is subject to the same evolutionary forces as species in that math that does not work quickly dies, never again to propagate itself into the mathematical &#39;gene pool.&#39;</span></p><p><span>The same is true for any idea or theory. Ideas such as the phlogiston theory of fire and Descartes theory of the motion of planets are examples of conceptual offspring that were quickly dispatched by the deadly and merciless hand of proof. It&#39;s a bit different on the social level, where we see failed political and economic ideologies that, although their ruin is inevitable from the start, they continue to pop up, for, in the realms of ideology, proof is often eclipsed by belief, hope, power and mass hysteria.</span></p><p><span>A sounder argument that reason was discovered is that the systems we have created with our reasoning abilities, from plumbing to artificial intelligence (AI), have come to the same conclusion as nature when faced with similar challenges, such as water distribution, blood cell design, language, etc. In the case of AI, armed with our rules of reason, it has significantly out-designed human solutions many times. These improved solutions were derived by observing the situation and applying the laws of reason that we instructed the AI system with, laws that we ourselves derived from observing our reality. The fact that AI is coming up with solutions that not only exceed ours but are more in harmony with nature is pretty good evidence that the laws of reason are objectively verifiable and existed before humans arrived on the scene.</span></p><p><span>In any case, both sides can agree, for the most part, that math is the language man invented to describe the existing laws he discovered and likewise, reasoning is the process man invented to describe the unfolding order of existence that he was capable of perceiving. This is a sufficiently satisfactory answer with regard to math and reason, but reasoning, in general, has a lot more gray area than mathematics.</span></p><h2><a name="the-limits-of-reason" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>The Limits of Reason</span></h2><p><span>Reason has been pretty effective in describing our reality, but it has its limits, at least in the way we use it today.</span></p><p><span>For example, the traditional Law of Thought</span><sup><a href='#17'><span>17</span></a></sup><span> goes something like:</span></p><ul><li><strong><span>The Law of Non-Contradiction states:</span></strong></li></ul><blockquote><p><span>“Nothing can both exist and not exist at the same time and in the same respect, or no statement is both true and false.”</span></p></blockquote><ul><li><strong><span>The Law of Excluded Middle states:</span></strong></li></ul><blockquote><p><span>“Something either exists or does not exist, or every statement is either true or false.”</span></p></blockquote><ul><li><strong><span>The Law of Identity states:</span></strong></li></ul><blockquote><p><span>“Everything is the same as itself, or a statement cannot remain the same and change its truth value.”</span></p></blockquote><p><span>These laws are much like math, in fact, they have their own algebraic notation: ∼(p·∼p), F(x)⊃F(x)</span><strong><span>,</span></strong><span> (∀x) (x=x), respectively.</span></p><p><span>It seems reasonable to assert that these laws existed before we came up with a way to define them. We certainly did not invent the fact that something cannot “be” and “not be” at the same time. We discovered that this is a property of our reality, or rather, in the way we perceive our reality. If we broaden our perceptions to include the reality that something </span><em><span>can be</span></em><span> and </span><em><span>cannot be</span></em><span> at the same time, then our reasoning must adapt.</span></p><p><span>A hardcore Aristotelian materialist might say “The law of non-contradiction specifically forbids something to be in a state of existence and non-existence. The universe has a transcendent self-consistent order, and that order cannot be violated. Its primary manifestation is thus: it exists, and it cannot be otherwise”, while a Platonist might say something can exist as an archetype but not as a material instance. A scientist might suggest that something can exist implicitly, but not explicitly, like the ink drop, and a Hindu guru might mess everything up by saying “The One is both </span><em><span>Sat</span></em><span> (existing) and </span><em><span>Asat</span></em><span> (non-existing).”</span></p><p><span>It would appear that the laws of reason depend on the scope of one&#39;s perspective and what one accepts as axiomatic or true, transcendental or otherwise. How, then, can these laws be preexisting if they contradict each other? This is sort of like the fable of the blind men and the elephant, where one blind man holding the elephant&#39;s tail describes it as a snake, and the other, holding the foot, describes it as a tree, or perhaps like the brilliant sculptures of Mathew Robert Ortis, such as “Revolution Giraffes”, which looks like a giraffe from one angle, but an elephant from another.</span></p><center><img src="../Images/016-eleph-giraf.png" style="width:90%"></center><p><span>The blind men and the viewers of the sculpture are all perceiving a preexisting form that is undebatably “true”, but they can&#39;t seem to agree on what it is.</span></p><p><span>Each of these fine folks can easily define and defend their worldview. They are all able to recognize the reality they have accepted as true, supported by the reasoning of that truth.</span></p><h3><a name="labels-and-names" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Labels and Names</span></h3><p><span>In all cases, before one can proclaim some thing&#39;s existence, that thing has to be named and something about it must be known, or at least presumed. We can&#39;t say something exists if we have no idea what it is we are making that claim about. We can see this readily in the way languages form ideas and labels which become the foundation of cultural understanding.</span></p><p><span>I can say my dog exists because I know </span><em><span>my</span></em><span> dog, I know </span><em><span>of</span></em><span> dogs, and everyone I know also knows of dogs.

To be clear, this is not meant to suggest these observations are, or are not, as valid as any other. Any system&#39;s validity depends solely on the contextual effectiveness of the reasoning behind it and the ability of that reasoning to produce verifiably accurate statements about it.</span></p><p><span>It would be hubris to write-off alternative views of reality given every culture in the world has a concept of some sort of paranormal, metaphysical energy. Some of these cultures have extremely demanding training and lengthy education to tap into it. Even our western icons, such as Paracelsus, Hippocrates, Carl Jung, Erwin Schrodinger, and Plato have referred to it.</span></p><p><span>For better or worse, it seems that pretty much anything can be a Truth as long as people can recognize it and support it with whatever sort of reasoning they happen to be using. For our purposes, we are only concerned with reasoning that is based on the laws of nature, as they are perceived. We need only look at history, and some places on the planet, to see the many versions of truth that have evolved, and how dramatically they differ from each other.</span></p><h3><a name="the-truth-about-truth" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>The Truth about Truth </span></h3><p><span>This raises the Big Question…What is truth?</span></p><p><span>This is a question we can never answer absolutely. We can&#39;t speak about what the ultimate truth is because there is no fool-proof way, no absolute proof, that any one way of looking at something is the “right” way. All we can speak about is what is the most reasonable understanding given the context of our reality and our perceptions of it. What, then, is the arbiter of proof as to whether something is “reasonably true” or not, given our current understanding of reality?</span></p><p><span>One arbiter is, of course, power. When Friedrich Nietzsche said “There is no truth, only power”, he was half right. Truth is a journey of discovery, while power is a battle for who gets to navigate that journey.</span></p><h3><a name="sustainability" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Sustainability</span></h3><p><span>Outside of that battlefield of culture and politics, we do have at least one gauge, and that is the measure of sustainability. This sustainability may be the best test as to the validity of something because its explicit existence alone is proof it exists in accordance with the rules of reality.</span></p><p><span>Achieving sustainability is more likely in a balanced environment as that is the optimum state for energy to create patterns from which order will emerge from chaos. Energy always seeks to achieve a balance; therefore, sustainability is the measure of the degree that order and balance can be maintained. Unsustainability will result in chaos.</span></p><p><span>This raises an interesting question: if (high-entropy) chaos is the ultimate state of the Universe, then it must also be the most sustainable as it will never change once arrived at. Oddly, this appears to be true.</span></p><p><span>All the movement of energy that exists at every level of reality is the result of energy seeking the path of least resistance as it attempts to balance itself out. We see examples of this everywhere, such as when we add hydrochloric acid with sodium hydroxide. After an extremely violent readjustment phase that releases a ton of energy (heat), it settles down to the very stable, lower energy-demanding products of water and table salt.</span></p><p><span>The Universe, starting with the extremely violent Big Bang and ending (according to popular theory) in a bunch of inert matter, the cosmic equivalent of water and table salt, is essentially the readjustment phase of different states of imbalance coming to terms with one another. Reality is the reaction of this adjustment, and like the chemical reaction just mentioned, will ultimately balance out and just sit there, doing nothing.</span></p><p><span>The ultimate destination of sustainability, on the cosmic scale, is death. On our level of existence, sustainability means keeping the various part of the “balancing machine” of nature working properly. In both cases sustainability means balance, but with two very different results of short-term, or </span><em><span>temporal</span></em><span> balance and long-term, or </span><em><span>supernal</span></em><span> balance.

No, because the pion&#39;s existence, short as it is, is necessary, otherwise it would never have existed in the first place, but the validity of a pion, essentially the truth of its explicit existence, is only valid for 26 nanoseconds while the validity of a black hole is forever (as 6x10</span><sup><span>99</span></sup><span> years is actually longer than the life span of the Universe).

It would become unsustainable, or it would make the larger organism unsustainable. This is actually what cancer is, the malformed reproduction of cells that reduce organisms sustainability. Interestingly, the cancer cell itself can be quite sustainable as an independent cell and only becomes a problem as a community of cells.</span></p><p><span>For a cell to be sustainable, to continue existing, only one process, made up of numerous detailed steps, all of which must function properly, will result in successful functioning and reproduction. More importantly, we can&#39;t explain why any one particular option in any step, out of the countless theoretical options available at each step, is the one step that the process ‘knows&#39; to select.</span></p><p><span>To put this in even clearer perspective, using twenty amino acids to create a very small protein (150 amino acids), there are 10</span><sup><span>77</span></sup><span> possible combinations.

Very few, and of those few only one will work, that being the one that works with the others it must integrate with. It&#39;s not quite as bad as the likelihood of a million monkeys banging on a million typewriters to eventually produce the entire works of Shakespeare, but considering it would take 2,737,850 million-billion-billion-billion monkey-years to write the line from Hamlet “RUMOUR.

Intelligent Designers will say that this was “biochemical predeterminism”, i.e. that the process was preprogrammed, somehow. Both of these answers are just kicking the can down the road, that ‘can&#39; being the question of where and how this historical record of what worked and what didn&#39;t work is stored along with the knowledge of a very strict set of rules and conditions that informs the process, along with and how this data is it accessed.</span></p><p><span>Let&#39;s take a look at a couple of macro examples on the social human scale and examine the serious questions it raises about the way we understand it.</span></p><h3><a name="ayahuasca" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Ayahuasca</span></h3><p><span>One of the more fascinating details about </span><em><span>ayahuasca</span></em><span>, a ritual psychoactive drink from the Amazon, is how it is made and how it was discovered in the first place. The main active ingredient of ayahuasca is N, N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT). DMT is a powerful hallucinogenic drug that exists in plants (and the human brain) yet has no effect on humans when taken orally because of the enzyme </span><em><span>monoamine oxidase</span></em><span> (MAO) in our blood that prevents it from passing the blood/brain barrier, which is a semipermeable membrane that separates the blood from the cerebrospinal fluid and which blocks many cells, particles, and large molecules, from entering the brain. This is a very good thing, as there is a lot of stuff floating around in our blood that can really mess with the brain.</span></p><p><span>In order for the DMT to get to the brain, it has to pass through the blood/brain barrier, and for that to happen there must be something that stops the MAOs from doing its job. That thing is called a </span><em><span>MAO Inhibitor</span></em><span> (MAOI). MAOIs are commonly used in pharmaceuticals to help with ailments such as depression and Parkinson&#39;s disease (which, according to Stanford University, are the same two things that tango dancing also helps).</span></p><p><span>Modern science has known about both of these drugs for a little over 100 years. Indigenous Amazonian shamans have known about them for about 5,000 years. Somehow, in a manner beyond the ability of modern Western man to comprehend, these shamans managed to discover that the bark of one particular vine, from over 40,000 species of plants, contained a lot of DMT. They also, somehow, knew that an MAOI was needed, which they found in another of those 40,000 species. Traditional anthropologists would have you believe they discovered this by trial and error, but with just a little thought, it is clear how ridiculous that theory is.</span></p><p><span>Of the 1,600,000,000 possible pairing combinations of Amazonian plants, only one produces ayahuasca, and even then, only when a certain part of the plants are used. In addition, these 1,600,000,000 possibilities do not consider the variables of proportion or the specifics of preparation. For that many trial-and-error tests, even if every man, woman, and child in all of South America partook in the finding, preparing, and experimenting, it would take over 2,000 years, which then raises the question of record-keeping as to what was already tested. The fact that modern science expects any semi-intelligent person to believe its trial-and-error theory is laughable, but also pretty frightening that so many scientists </span><em><span>do</span></em><span> believe this.</span></p><h3><a name="curare" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Curare</span></h3><p><span>For other substances, such as the paralyzing poison </span><em><span>curare</span></em><span> used by South American indigenous people for hunting, the chances are astronomically greater.</span></p><p><span>Curare is a poison that paralyzes an animal, but soon after being paralyzed the poison is metabolized by the animal, rendering it harmless. That is obviously a pretty essential requirement, as you can&#39;t be eating the same poison you used to catch the animal. Just imagining that the locals knew of this requirement and then set out to find such a drug somewhere in the Amazon is difficult for modern anthropologists to accept.</span></p><p><span>Beyond that, there are 172 different types of this one-in-40000 species in the jungle, and only one of them works, but the real kicker is that the fumes one is exposed to while preparing the curare are fatal! How does modern science imagine this was achieved?</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>Wanadi:</span></em><span> “Trumak! Mojie just died testing that new batch of curare!”</span></p><p><em><span>Trumak:</span></em><span> “Bummer. And he was so close! Go and try that again, with the same batch…and remember to keep smelling it. That&#39;s how you know it&#39;s done.”</span></p><p><span>Wanadi: “OK!”</span></p></blockquote><p><span>On the other hand, if one were to ask a shaman how these things were discovered, he would simply say, “The plants told us.” Other cultures who have similar stories might say their ancestors told them, or the crickets, or the bones of a sacred animal, or the cracks in the shell of a tortoise after it has been heated and then dropped into cold water and then compared to the position of the stars, as was the case with the origins of the Chinese I-Ching.</span></p><p><span>For Western man, talking to plants, insects or bones is usually followed by pharmaceuticals prescribed by a psychiatrist. For just about every other indigenous culture, including the indigenous culture that Western civilization grew from, they had some way to tap into this organic database of knowledge.</span></p><p><span>Just as a cellular transcriptor has the intelligence necessary to manage its sustainability, which is then managed by the intelligence of a cell, and up the chain this continues all the way to a human being (which is just a stop along the journey, as we humans are part of a yet larger system), it is not unreasonable to presume there is an intelligence that manages </span><em><span>its</span></em><span> components of humans.</span></p><p><span>Our ancestors called this intelligence ‘the voice of the gods&#39; and about 5,000 years ago we started to create the idea of an all-in-one-version of the gods. This was a very practical idea and worked very well given the context and scope of our ancestor&#39;s world view. It gave one name to all things unknown and satisfied their need for a sense of truth and order. Once named it was left to humans to try and describe that truth and order.</span></p><h2><a name="the-human-brain-and-reason" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>The Human Brain and Reason</span></h2><p><span>The American Psychologist Julian Jaynes, in his very popular book “</span><em><span>The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind”</span></em><span> (1976) presents his theory of the evolution of the human brain, wherein he claims that our ancestors heard voices in their heads instructing them what they needed to do and needed to know, and these voices of unknown origin were attributed to the “gods”, and therefore became the voice of Truth.</span></p><blockquote><p><img src="../Images/019-bicameral-brain.jpg" style="float:right;width:35%" /><span>“Who then were these gods that pushed men about like robots and sang epics through their lips? They were voices whose speech and directions could be as distinctly heard by the Iliadic heroes as voices are heard by certain epileptic and schizophrenic patients, or just as Joan of Arc heard her voices. The gods were organizations of the central nervous system and can be regarded as personae in the sense of poignant consistencies through time, amalgams of parental or admonitory images. The god is a part of the man, and quite consistent with this conception is the fact that the gods never step outside of natural laws.”</span><sup><a href='#21'><span>21</span></a></sup></p></blockquote><p><span>Jaynes claims that a bit before 1000 BC (just around the time of the Tower of Babel by Sumerian accounts) the human consciousness was not yet ‘meta-conscious&#39;, meaning humans were not aware of their awareness. The bicameral part of Jaynes theory suggests that there were two parts of the brain, the one that managed mundane jobs, habits, rote tasks, etc. (the self), and another part which, when faced with confusing and/or difficult challenges, took over (the voice of god).</span></p><blockquote><p><span>[</span><span>For bicameral humans</span><span>]</span><span>, volition came as a voice that was in the nature of a neurological command, in which the command and the action were not separated, in which to hear was to obey.</span></p><p><span>Sidenote: What we call the “ego” today evolved out of that really boring and mundane “self” part of the brain, so it&#39;s probably best not to use it for anything other than mundane tasks.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>According to Jaynes, the transition from bicameralism to consciousness (linguistic meta-cognition) occurred over the period from 1800 BC to 800 BC. We know this time as the time from when Hammurabi ruled Babylonia, where he wrote down one of the first set of laws known to humanity dealing with challenging and confusing issues such as contracts, wages, liability, inheritance, divorce, paternity, and reproductive behavior, to name a few, to the founding of Rome. This metamorphosis of consciousness ushered in the golden age of empires and cultures that laid the foundation of Western Civilization in areas of art, literature, theatre, government, philosophy, mathematics, and even sports. (</span><em><span>I am singling out Western culture simply because that is the culture I best understand and which has the most information available, and not because I do not think other cultures have not developed along their own lines under similar conditions.)</span></em></p><p><span>From the days of Rome and the ancient Greek philosophers to today our bicameralism has further diminished, which can account for the decreasing incidents of people hearing the gods speak to them. This may have been a good thing, but the problem that arose as a result of the gods abandoning us, forcing us to apply reason to challenging problems when our pleas for guidance were ignored, is that our newly developed tools of reason rejected any ideas that we could not understand, which were many given we were still new at the whole reasoning thing during some very desperate times. Our fledgling ability to consciously make sense of things seemed to be working, so it naturally dominated our world view, even if we were, and are, still figuring out how it works.</span></p><p><span>Still, as Jaynes so eloquently puts it:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>The mind is still haunted with its old unconscious ways; it broods on lost authorities; and the yearning, the deep and hollowing yearning for divine volition and service is with us still.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Hence, religion.</span></p><p><span>Anything and everything that did not fit into the highly constrained and “reasonable” worldview was pushed farther and farther outside the box of mainstream thought until we arrived at where we are today. In one way this ‘inquisition-by-reason&#39;, which served to purge heretical thoughts from the dogma of the cult of reason, was, and is, quite necessary and useful, because in the reformation that has begun, those ancient ideas that can withstand the tests of our deeper understanding of reason will be resurrected in a new form with modern understanding.</span></p><p><span>The memories of the cell, the voices in our ancestor&#39;s heads, the wisdom of the plants as heard by the shamans, and countless other instances of “divine” or “mystical” knowledge, all beg the same questions: Where does this information come from? Where is it stored? How does one access it?</span></p><p><span>Perhaps </span><em><span>reason</span></em><span> has evolved to the point where we may be able to answer these questions, reasonably.</span></p><h2><a name="the-path-of-reason" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>The Path of Reason</span></h2><p><span>The rules and conditions of reality that we have discovered have followed a perfectly reasonable path long before man was able to claim them as such.

It wasn&#39;t until Kepler discovered the pattern by plotting the paths on a logarithmic chart that the reasoning became clear. This became Kepler&#39;s Third Law of Planetary Motion that states </span><em><span>“the square of the planet&#39;s orbital period is proportional to the cube of its distance from the sun.”</span></em></p><p><span>In the same manner, we discovered DNA is a helix because of hydrogen bonds, etc., so we can say “Here is a pattern and the rules that created it.”</span></p><p><span>This is not to say everything that the gatekeepers of the Church of Reason consider “unreasonable”, such as myths, magic, aliens, hyper-dimensional beings, and numerous other paranormal, metaphysical areas are, indeed, “unreasonable.” On the contrary, it&#39;s quite unreasonable to presume they have no reasoning behind them as many of these ideas perfectly conform to natural law, albeit within a scope that extends outside our common boundaries. Historical examples of once unreasonable ideas include electricity, flight, wireless communications, space travel, nuclear energy and pretty much the majority of the reality of modern life. These things were considered nothing less than magic and science fiction until we were able to recognize it and discover the rules of how they worked. Once we discovered Bernoulli&#39;s law</span><sup><a href='#22'><span>22</span></a></sup><span> works in harmony with the law of gravity we mastered the magic art of flying.</span></p><h4><a name="claim-22-reason-is-the-codification-of-the-rules-of-a-reality-as-we-have-come-to-know-it" class="md-header-anchor"></a><strong><span>Claim 22:</span></strong><span> Reason is the codification of the rules of a reality as we have come to know it. </span></h4><h3><a name="the-benevolence-of-self-preservation" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>The benevolence of self-preservation</span></h3><p><span>If our reasoning is based on the world we observe, then this implies that everything in nature, everything in the universe, must, therefore, be reasonable, but sometimes the reasoning we have derived from our observations is inaccurate or lacking.</span></p><h4><a name="claim-23-the-rules-of-reason-are-predetermined-based-on-the-rules-of-our-reality-that-we-have-recognized-and-these-rules-require-that-any-reason-that-exists-must-abide-by-them" class="md-header-anchor"></a><strong><span>Claim 23:</span></strong><span> The rules of reason are predetermined based on the rules of our reality that we have recognized, and these rules require that any “reason” that exists must abide by them. </span></h4><p><span>Take, for example, our reasoning behind the evolutionary drive for self-preservation. We assume it is a somewhat selfish, even if necessary, biological drive passed down through our genes in order to increase the genes chances of reproducing itself. This makes sense if we see the world as a bunch of individual entities competing for dominance.</span></p><p><span>Another way to see self-preservation is from the perspective of the larger organism that is composed of many contributing organisms.</span></p><p><span>Take the example of a collective, such as a tribe. If the collective is destroyed, then all its members also suffer from that loss. The collective, then, has a strong responsibility to the members. On the other hand, if the members were to become damaged in some way, the collective suffers as well. So, the collective will both attempt to preserve itself for the sake of its members and preserve the members for the sake of itself. We don&#39;t think of a collective as an organism, but all organisms are collectives, therefore collectives </span><em><span>can</span></em><span> be organisms. Now apply this reasoning to an animal. The animal will attempt to preserve itself for the sake of its members (organs, limbs, cells, etc.), and preserve its members for the sake of itself.</span></p><p><span>From the perspective of the parent organism, such as the collective, it is worth losing a member if that means it will benefit the collective and/or the ability of the collective to preserve its members.</span></p><p><span>One example of this are the cardiac muscle cells that have the self-preservation ability to duck, dart, and dodge foreign substances, but these actions may harm the cells to the point where they can cause a fatal heart attack, all in an attempt to preserve themselves, even though they are killing their parent organism.</span></p><p><span>Some theorize that they do this because there is a greater chance of the heart surviving if the cells can avoid damage and hold out for the possibility of the heart being resuscitated. A far more reasonable explanation is that the component elements of a person (the cells, in this case) are compelled to preserve </span><em><span>their</span></em><span> component elements (nucleus, chromatins, cytoplasm, organelles, etc.). Killing the parent organism is not its concern, nor within the scope of its influence as. Preservation of the members is the concern of the parent organism, who has obviously failed in its duty to protect its components in the example given. The sacrificed parent organism of </span><em><span>person</span></em><span>, which would be the collective (tribe, community, country, etc.) will only lose one (improperly functioning) member.</span></p><p><span>In this particular example of cardiac cells, their self-preservation can be fatal to the collective, but in most cases losing a few cells is not fatal to the collective, still, and by the same token, the </span><em><span>uber</span></em><span> organism that humans are a part of (family, society, government, etc.) only forfeits one human. This is happening in our own bodies 60 billion times a day, as that is how many of our own cells dies, and are created, every day.</span></p><h4><a name="claim-23a-the-most-efficient-model-for-a-collective-is-individual-self-preservation" class="md-header-anchor"></a><strong><span>Claim 23A</span></strong><span>: The most efficient model for a collective is individual self-preservation.</span></h4><p><span>Seeing self-preservation more as a protecting-the-family-of-component-parts makes much more sense </span><em><span>if</span></em><span> we also see that every organism in the hierarchy of life, from cells to cities, as an individual entity,</span></p><p><span>Just as an entity will endanger its collective in an attempt to preserve its members, a collective will sacrifice a member for the betterment of the whole.</span></p><p><span>This perspective also explains how a person is able to sacrifice itself for the sake of another, even though they have no genetic connection to the other person, ruling out genetic preference as is the case when a parent sacrifices themselves for their child. This would also suggest that our most basic drive is not the survival of the self, but the survival of something more important than the self. We see this in cases of love, honor, country, god, etc.</span></p><p><span>You might be thinking that is a trait unique to humans, but this is not the case. We see cases of this in single-cell organisms</span><sup><a href='#23'><span>23</span></a></sup><span>, multi-cellular organisms</span><sup><a href='#24'><span>24</span></a></sup><span>, such as slime mold, where, when faced with scant resources, certain cells will sacrifice themselves for the sake of the greater organism.</span><sup><a href='#25'><span>25</span></a></sup><span>, virulence parasites</span><sup><a href='#26'><span>26</span></a></sup><span>, plants</span><sup><a href='#27'><span>27</span></a></sup><span>, to name a few.

With ideas such as wave functions and the many-worlds theory of quantum physics, the morphic field of biology, the research into hyper-time telepathic communication (for long-distance space travel), self-determining AI, etc., it&#39;s easy to see how what we accept as “reasonable” will dramatically change as we learn how these new processes of reality work.</span></p><p><span>Some may see this as an example of “Intelligent Design.” We prefer the term “Coherent Integration” to represent an integrated self-similar pattern of moving energy that extends far above and below that sliver of the reality spectrum that we are attuned to perceive.</span></p><h4><a name="claim-24-there-is-an-order-to-creative-processes-and-creations-themselves-are-a-product-of-order" class="md-header-anchor"></a><strong><span>Claim 24:</span></strong><span> There is an order to creative processes, and creations themselves are a product of order. </span></h4><h2><a name="redundancy--reason--cycles" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Redundancy + Reason = Cycles</span></h2><p><span>Cycles are the way we describe </span><em><span>“any complete round or series of occurrences that repeats or is repeated.”</span></em><span> Cycles, as we understand and define them, are the product of applying reason to the redundancies and repeating patterns we observe around us, and even within us.</span></p><p><span>How have we used our reasoning skills to understand the nature of reality and our universe? As a starting point, we can begin by looking at how we believe this reality came into existence in the first place.</span></p><p><span>Here are some of the more popular ideas that represent our best reasoning abilities about how everything that exists began.</span></p><h3><a name="big-bang" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Big Bang</span></h3><p><span>This seems to be the most popular theory, which states that 14 billion years ago, there was nothing and nowhere, the primal void. Then, for reasons unknown, something the size of a subatomic particle appeared in this void of nothingness and in a fraction of a second, expanded to fill the entirety of the void (which is estimated to be about 90 billion light-years wide, so far).</span></p><p><span>Can you see the relationship between the Big Bang Theory and the harmonograph as a device that takes an initial push and then takes some time to create a two-dimensional design on a blank surface as that initial energy slowly diminishes? If one could imagine a 12-dimensional harmonograph with countless variables in each dimension, one might be able to imagine how it could ‘draw&#39; a 3-dimensional universe.</span></p><h3><a name="eternal-inflation" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Eternal Inflation</span></h3><p><span>This is also called a ‘Level II Multiverse&#39; and states a) after the big bang the universe never stopped inflating, b) that this has been going on for an infinite amount of time and c) it continually creates new universes (multiverses) that also exist for infinite time. It is not clear how something can have a beginning, can be created, and yet exist for infinite time as there can be no ‘beginning&#39; to infinite time, but we&#39;re talking quantum theory stuff, so, I guess anything is possible in that world where time and space may mean something different then what we are used to.</span></p><h3><a name="oscillating-universe" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Oscillating Universe</span></h3><p><span>Also called the ‘cyclic model&#39;, and involves an endless series of Big Bangs, followed Big Crunches, and is explained by the collisions of high-dimensional ‘membranes&#39; in a higher-dimensional space.</span></p><p><span>The question this model raises is, does the ‘memory&#39; of the previous ‘bangs&#39; service each crunch? We address the idea of universal memory later, so we won&#39;t get into out here other that ask, is each new bang a hard reset?</span></p><h3><a name="holographic-simulation-hypothesis" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Holographic simulation hypothesis </span></h3><p><span>The idea that reality is “just” a simulation has been around for a long time. The roots of such an idea go back to the “Skeptical hypotheses” of ancient Greece and the “The Butterfly Dream” of 3rd century B.C. Chinese philosopher Zhuang Zhou. These ideas found more form in the “Cartesian doubt” of René Descartes, finally culminating in Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom&#39;s “Simulation hypothesis” theory and book </span><em><span>“Are you living in a computer simulation?”</span></em><span> in 2003 (also a doumentary</span><sup><a href='#29'><span>29</span></a></sup><span>).</span></p><p><span>This theory that we live in a simulation has moved out of the philosopher&#39;s chair and into the science lab where bits of supporting evidence was discovered.</span></p><p><span>In this scenario, the Big Bang would be the equivalent of a cosmic hackers flipping the “on” switch to their Reality Framework Server.</span></p><p><span>This theory posits that reality is a simulated projection and black holes are the projectors, with the </span><em><span>event horizon</span></em><span> of a black hole (the point from which nothing escapes) acting as a diffraction grid for the energy it is projecting to form a ‘reality&#39;, just like a hologram.</span></p><p><span>We think of this world as analog, but it may well be digital, but at a level of resolution far beyond our ability to grasp. This grid is made up of a series 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s, each &#39;bit&#39; occupying a square Plank length. To put this in perspective, the number of ‘bits&#39; on the surface of </span><em><span>V616 Monocerotis</span></em><span>, our nearest black hole a mere 3,000 lightyears away, is around 2.3313x10</span><sup><span>88</span></sup><span>. There are only 10</span><sup><span>82</span></sup><span> atoms in the universe (we think), so, that is a big number.</span></p><p><span>This is just from one of the 100 million black holes in our galaxy alone, and we already know of 500 billion galaxies just within our range of observation, so we know of at least 5 x 10</span><sup><span>19</span></sup><span> “reality projecting CPUs” (for lack of a better term), that are all working in perfect synchronization.</span></p><p><span>Even more mind-bending is the possibility that the reality that is being projected is only ‘rendered&#39; on-demand, i.e. this reality simulation creates wave functions of possibilities but they only ‘collapse&#39; into form when they are observed. Apparently creating actual physical reality is a ‘CPU&#39; intensive task… or perhaps this reality was developed by creators that could only get their hands on a low-end simulator.</span></p><p><span>I would also question the use of the word “simulation”, for that implies it is an artificial rendition of something that already exists. It is more like a bona fide creation, albeit one that may have been designed around a specific model, or for a specific (yet unknown) purpose.</span></p><p><span>What is missing in these descriptions and current theories are many of those ideas that are not based in science, but rather legend, creation myths and beliefs. I don&#39;t include them not because they are not valid, but simply because there are too many of them, but modern theories are surprisingly in-line with the creation myths of the Judeo-Christian, Islam, Hindu, Zoroastrian, Taoist, Buddhist and even Aboriginal Australian, the world&#39;s oldest</span>
<span>civilization</span><sup><a href='#30'><span>30</span></a></sup><span>. We would expect to see this similarity between radically different models of reasoning if they were all attempting to understand the same thing.</span></p><p><span>The common thread of modern and ancient creation theories and stories is that they are all versions of the plotline that there was </span><em><span>nothingness</span></em><span>, followed by a </span><em><span>somethingness</span></em><span>, and everything that ever did or ever will exist does so between these two states of chaos.</span></p><h4><a name="claim-25-all-dualities-stem-from-the-first-duality" class="md-header-anchor"></a><strong><span>Claim 25:</span></strong><span> All dualities stem from the first duality. </span></h4><h3><a name="what-goes-where" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>What Goes Where? </span></h3><p><span>If the two opposing end-points of the spectrum of our reality are somethingness and nothingness, that leaves a lot of space for pretty much anything to exist.</span></p><p><span>The range of possibilities between these two (or any two) states is naturally distributed and looks something like your standard Bell curve. There is a very good reason for this: because the probabilities of what can happen between two states, regardless of the number of variables at play, will always tends toward a </span><em><span>normal</span></em><span> distribution, in the statistical sense of the word.</span></p><p><span>If we had the Ultimate Bell curve between the states of nothingness (high entropy) and somethingness (low entropy), the part of the curve that represents the most sustainable condition of these two states would in the middle. This will be the point where there is the least amount of disorder and the highest probability for order as each side will be represented in the most balanced, and therefore sustainable, manner. This chart below is a general concept of this idea.</span></p><center><img src="../Images/021-supercurve1.png" style="width:90%"></center><p><span>We see this sort of distribution everywhere in nature. In fact, in the world of theoretical biology, this is called </span><em><span>environmental dimensionality</span></em><span> and describes how various biological systems</span>

This shows that the most efficient (most energetically ordered) function of our eyes is the perception of the color green. This makes sense as we evolved in a world that was very green thanks to chloraphyll and its oxygen producing photosynthesis. Other life-forms have other ranges of sensitivity depending on their context or environment.</span></p><center><img src="../Images/022-eyecurve1.png" style="width:90%"></center><p><span>The oscillations between two states, be they the two states of chaos, order, and disorder, or any two points that are different yet can form an interaction, is the most basic form of energetic expression in all the orders of creation.</span></p><p><span>This is one area where metaphysics, spirituality, and science all happily converge: everything exists in a duality of some sort.</span></p><p><span>Were this duality to no longer exist in a state of imbalance or difference, the cycles of creations would also cease. How, then, is a stable state of imbalance always maintained? Remember the example of the two lakes, one higher than the other? Once all the water has moved to the lower lake the water just sits there, doing nothing, and that is the end of the cycle unless somehow the water gets moved back into the higher lake. Nature does this quite effectively by drawing up the molecules of water from the lake into the sky, transporting them via clouds, and dropping them back into the lake, thereby ensuring the cycle of energy remains operating. Difference must be maintained for energy to work, and nature&#39;s job seems to be to maintain a perfect balance of difference.</span></p><h2><a name="waves" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Waves</span></h2><p><span>When we look at simple waves, such as light waves, radio waves, sound waves, we see an oscillation of energy. This is the result of movement of energy over time.</span></p><p><span>On the atomic level, there are electromagnetic waves, such as light, X-rays, radio waves, etc. On the material level, we have mechanical waves, such as sound waves. On the organic level and beyond (planets, life, culture, politics,</span>
<span>etc.</span><sup><a href='#32'><span>32</span></a></sup><span>) we don&#39;t use the term </span><em><span>waves</span></em><span>, instead, we call them </span><em><span>cycles</span></em><span>, but they represent the same thing.</span></p><p><img src="../Images/023-sinewave.png" style="float:right;width:1.39792in;height:0.49861in" /><span>If we look at a typical wave model, which is one cycle of a quantity of energy moving over a period of time, we say that the time it takes to complete one cycle is the frequency, and the distance it covers in one cycle is the wavelength.</span></p><p><span>Typically we use the terms that describe a wave to describe radiation and vibration, such as light and sound, but we </span><em><span>could</span></em><span> say the moon has a wavelength of about 50 million km, with a frequency of 0.00599584916 Hz, or that migration cycle of the Arctic Tern, a bird that flies back and forth between the Arctic and the Antarctic every year has a frequency of 1/yr., with a wavelength of 70,000 km (which is how far they travel every year).</span></p><p><span>We don&#39;t because it&#39;s cumbersome, non-intuitive and fairly useless information in our current paradigm.</span></p><p><span>As meaningless as these terms are for such cases, it does not take away from the idea that these natural cycles are the expressions of the same law that light waves operate under, but on a different level of expression, on a higher order of complexity, size and dependency where instead of photons we have birds and planets.</span></p><p><span>Here&#39;s another example of the interdependent cycles of cohabitating rabbits and coyotes. It might sound ridiculous to compare X-rays with prey-predator cycles, but both of them share the most basic functions, the transference of energy in an attempt to create balance, just in two very different scopes and contexts.</span></p><center><img src="../Images/024-predcycle.png" style="width:65%" alt="predator.png"></center><p><span>Let&#39;s compare the properties of two classes of waves; electromagnetic (subatomic particles) and mechanical (particles).</span></p><table><thead><tr class="header"><th><strong>Mechanical Waves</strong></th><th><strong>Electromagnetic Waves</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Travels fastest in the densest matter<br>

We would expect energy to express its movement quite differently when operating under the laws of subatomic particles than that of matter. To put this in perspective, consider that an electron is 100 million times smaller than an atom, and 20 trillion times smaller than a chromosome, let alone the sizes we are talking about for typical M wave medium, like things you can hold in your hand. Compare that to the Milky Way galaxy, which is 167,256,410 times the size of our solar system, and the earth is only 1/38000 the size of that. The difference between an electron and a beach ball is about the same difference between a beach ball and the entire galaxy. With that in mind, consider that the ratio of the actual universe compared to the observable universe is equivalent to an atom compared to the observable universe. It&#39;s easy to imagine how things might operate a little differently at these different scales.</span></p><center><img src="../Images/025-beachball.png" style="width:90%" alt="beachball.png"></center><p><span>More important than the differences are the similarities, such as the way energy travels through a medium via waves. All forms of energy are simply a redirection of energy from one state to another, as energy is neither created nor destroyed. This is the very first law of thermodynamics, the conservation of energy. We have identified many forms of energy: sound, chemical, radiant, electrical, atomic, mechanical, elastic, ionization, gravitational, dark (that&#39;s the energy causing the universe to expand faster than we think it should), so is it unreasonable to imagine still more forms of energy? Are emotions like love or fear, desires, thoughts, or even imagination a redirection of energy? And what form does that energy take? Can we say that we know of every type of medium and every type of cycle and the laws that control them?</span></p><p><span>We can only recognize energy as one form or another, not as pure energy itself. An everyday example of this is the fact that you can&#39;t see or detect light until the light energy hits something, like a wall or a dust particle. The real mind-bender here is that the dust particle itself is just energy (as all mass is energy according to </span><em><span>m = Ec</span><sup><span>2</span></sup></em><span>), so we can only see one form of energy when that energy interacts with another form of energy. As everything is energy interacting with energy it is easy to understand why we claim that everything that exists (i.e. has sustainable patterns of energy) must oscillate in some sort of medium and that we are not aware of every form of medium or expression of energy that exists.</span></p><p><span>We do not have words for many things as we have yet to recognize them and therefore can&#39;t describe them, measure them or even identify them.

In some contexts, this pattern is quite measurable, in others, it is analogous, such as in the migration pattern of the Arctic Tern.</span></p><center><img src="../Images/026-sinewaveplus.png" style="width:90%"></center><p><span>You can easily see the relationship between the oscillations of the two poles to many classic ideas of archetypal dualities, such as masculine/feminine, yin/yang, dark/light, etc., as well as the dualities that make up our day-to-day lives, such as day/night, summer/winter, phases of the moon and the movement of planets, the alternating current of common electricity, etc., and countless other dualities that the mind has imagined, created, or discovered since humans started observing the world around them.</span></p><p><span>In humanity&#39;s quest to understand reality, either through religion, economics, alchemy or science, we keep bumping into the same universal constants and concepts.</span></p><h1><a name="structure" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>STRUCTURE</span></h1><h6><a name="knowledge-and-information-like-form-has-a-structure-which-follows-the-same-rules-as-form" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Knowledge and information, like form, has a structure which follows the same rules as form.</span></h6><p><span>All of this may sound overly complicated, but the point of everything up until now was to introduce some of the main concepts that we will be returning to, or depending on, as we move forward as well as to touch on the main ideas that lead from the ultimate simplicity of a duality to more complex structures that describe the reality we actually live in.</span></p><p><span>It&#39;s about to get a lot more complicated. On a practical level, this complexity is no different than how we deal with the physical world in our every-day lives. When you hold a brick in your hand you are holding trillions of atomic particles, with countless interactions, fields, energy levels, etc., but you don&#39;t need to know that to build a house of bricks. When you drop the brick and it falls, you&#39;re not thinking about the nature of time, gravity, and warped space. Likewise, to manage the “bricks” in the realm of Ideas, you also don&#39;t need to know all of the details, but it is helpful if you have an idea of how they generally interact with each other so you don&#39;t try and build a “house” made of “bricks” and “oranges”.</span></p><p><span>That said; let&#39;s touch on one more thing that is truly mind-bendingly complicated, but also truly fascinating and relevant.</span></p><h2><a name="how-many-dimensions-are-there" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>How Many Dimensions Are There? </span></h2><p><span>When we say something has three dimensions what we are really saying is that something exists within the same multidimensional reality that we exist in, and under the same conditions, has three relative measurements of height, width, and length that indicate the difference between two absolute points.</span></p><p><span>When we say a nail is two inches long, we are referring to the difference between the universally absolute position of the head of the nail, and the universally absolute position of the tip of the nail, for one axis only. We have no idea what these universally absolute coordinates are, but we assume they are the same for everything in our reality.</span></p><p><span>In reality an object has many, many dimensions, it&#39;s just that the only ones that matter to us are the three we use, because all the other dimensions remain the same (enough) for all things that are in the same system (planet earth, for example).</span></p><p><span>Imagine that the speed of light was 55 miles per hour. If you were stand on the side of a highway, all the cars would look extremely squished, like a few millimeters in length, but the car&#39;s mass would also be much larger, so, I guess they would be very large cars that were a few millimeters in length. On top of that, time </span><em><span>inside</span></em><span> those cars would be much slower. In any case, space-time measurements get all weird once we are dealing with two different space-time contexts.</span></p><p><span>So when I need a part for my car delivered tomorrow that is 1x2x3, when I order it I am confident it will be 1x2x3 and arrive within 24 hours because I assume that whoever I ordered that part from lives in the same reality and context as me, and is not an alien-owned intergalactic warehouse in the 4</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span> dimension traveling close to the speed of light near a black hole.</span></p><p><span>The classic explanation of a dimension goes something like </span><em><span>“If something has only one dimension you only need one number to know its exact location.”</span></em><span> In the case of 1-dimension, like in the number line below, if there was a dot on number 6, the dot has a dimension of 6.</span></p><center><img src="../Images/035-numnberline.png" style="width:3.01597in;"></center><p><span>This is true when, and only when, the position of the measurer and the thing being measured share the same context, as the value of 6 is only relative to that context. If we wanted to give the absolute position of the dot, we would need to include the coordinates of where in the universe that dot exists, which would require the coordinates of who-knows-how-many larger contexts it was in when it was measured it … where on the planet, in the solar system, in the galaxy, in the multiverse, and all of those with the dimension of time, as they are all moving, and even then it would only be relative to the Universe as we know it. So, even a simple 1-dimensional dot can have a lot of absolute dimensions.</span></p><p><span>With that in mind, and limiting ourselves to our 3D reality (we&#39;ll come back to the multidimensional stuff very soon), what can we say about </span><em><span>things</span></em><span> that are universally common among all of them? Well, we can say at least the following:</span></p><ul><li><span>All things have (at least) 3 dimensions.</span></li><li><span>All things are made of other things.</span></li><li><span>All things are the most efficient form of that specific thing.</span></li></ul><p><img src="../Images/036-tetrahedron.png" style="FLOAT:RIGHT;width:1.21319in;height:1.21319in" /><span>This last statement might raise a few eyebrows. The claim here is not that any particular thing is the most efficient form of its perfect archetype, but rather the most efficient form for that particular thing under the conditions it exists in any particular moment. A nearly perfect snowball that begins to melt is clearly not the best expression of the archetype of a sphere, but it is the most energy-efficient form that snowball could take, which it </span><em><span>must</span></em><span> take as energy always seeks the path of least resistance.</span></p><p><span>If these statements are true, then this would imply that the most primitive thing that can exist, the simplest form possible, is the tetrahedron. Why? Because it is the most efficient form that can exist, it has 3 dimensions, but it is </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> made up of other things because when you remove any one point, it collapses to 2 dimensions, and no </span><em><span>thing</span></em><span> can be 2D. Therefore, it must the very first </span><em><span>thing</span></em><span> to come into existence, at least conceptually speaking.</span></p><p><span>As a pattern of order, it </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> one of the first to appear. In its most obvious form, we see this structure when we stack spheres on top of one another. If we stack other shapes, the structure will be altered to the degree the shape is not a sphere, but the tendency for all things that are connected to each other will be to form a tetrahedral structure to the degree the shape of the things connected will allow.</span></p><p><span>If the tetrahedron is the first thing that can be created, this would suggest also that every </span><em><span>thing</span></em><span> that exists is ultimately made of these smallest </span><em><span>things</span></em><span> (conceptually speaking), but that is a radical departure from our current thinking…but, not </span><em><span>that</span></em><span> radical a departure as this is exactly what </span><em><span>Emergence Theory: A Theory of Pixelated</span>

First, we had the grains of sand and dust, then atoms, then electrons, protons, and neutrons, then finally, quarks, which, so far, seem to be the most fundamental layer of matter. The problem is, quarks are “almost” infinitely small, which create all sorts of problems because science has a difficult time with infinity. To solve this, they came up with the idea that reality is made not of really tiny particles, but really tiny vibrating 11-dimensional ‘superstrings.&#39; Unfortunately, for all the evidence they have found to support this theory they might as well have said reality is made up of angels dancing on pinheads.</span></p><p><span>The quark remains the undefeated champion of tininess, but “almost” infinitely small is not the same as infinity small. How “almost” is it? One 43 billion-billionths of a centimeter (0. 43 x 10</span><sup><span>−17</span></sup><span> meters).

That is pretty, pretty big. What could be bigger than that? How about something with 4 dimensions? Would an extra dimension increase the size of something? Well, is a 2x2x2 cube bigger than a 2x2 sheet of paper? What would a 2x2x2x2 cube look like? In the 3D world, it would look like a regular cube, because we can only see 3 of the 4 dimensions, but turn it a little (in 4D space) and the 4D cube will appear as two 3D cubes, or a hexagonal prism, or rhombic dodecahedron, or a cuboid.</span></p><p><span>Here is what a hypercube (4D cube) looks like when it is rotated and projected onto a 2D space, like a shadow (orthographic projection).</span></p><center><img src="../Images/037-hypercubeisos.png" style="width:90%" alt="hypercube.png"></center><p><span>What about something that is 5D, or 6D or 7D? Each one would be bigger by an order of magnitude. How about something that is 248D? That would be very, very big. If something was bigger than the Great Wall in 248D how big would it appear in 3D? About the size of a small travel bag!! OK, you&#39;re probably thinking </span><em><span>“248D!? Come on, man.

Any system that has order will follow a pattern, and we can see these same patterns over and over again, from the electron to the galaxy, from flowers to computer networking. Our explanations of how realities work, whether we believe it was created by God in six days, or it&#39;s all a very sophisticated holographic projection, will have the same patterns of reasoning, albeit with different interpretations of the significance of those patterns.</span></p><center><img src="../Images/042-related-patterns.png" style="width:90%"></center><h2><a name="knowledge-by-any-other-name" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Knowledge by any other name</span></h2><p><span>We tend to think that ancient ideas were not based in science, at least in the way we describe that word today. This is partly true, in that we had not yet discovered the laws of nature to the degree, or in the manner, we now have, but we can find incredibly sophisticated reasoning and logic in some ancient ideas.</span></p><p><span>Take two examples mentioned above, the Taoist I-Ching and the Jewish Kabbalah. Both of these philosophies are based on the same concept of a reality that exists in a duality. While the Kabbalah is a top-down model of creation that describes 32 archetypes made up of 10 archetypal states of existence with 22 archetypes of energy that connect these states, the I-Ching is a fractally bifurcated whole of 10 pairs of balanced states and 22 pairs of imbalanced states that describe 32 pairs of archetypal states of the Tao.</span></p><p><span>Both are descriptions of the same thing as seen through the contextual cultural lens of understanding.</span></p><p><span>The story of the I Ching and Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz, the inventor of differential and integral calculus, is a fascinating story that exemplifies this. It&#39;s a bit of an aside, but it&#39;s relevant and worth the read.</span></p><h3><a name="leibniz" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Leibniz</span></h3><p><span>When the Jesuits, reputed to be the intellectuals among Christian missionaries, traveled to China, they were fascinated by the I-Ching. So much so that they brought it back to Europe in the late 1600s. It was here that Leibniz saw the I-Ching and claimed it to be sent by</span>
<span>God.</span><sup><a href='#42'><span>42</span></a></sup></p><p><span>Just prior to seeing the I-Ching, Leibniz had developed (discovered?) a number system that he considered sacred. It was the binary system of 0s and 1s, much like the Yin/Yang of the I-Ching. It was of no practical use to anyone at the time, but that was not why he developed it. Leibniz, a very pious man, thought that if all values could be expressed in terms of only something and nothing, on and off, yes and no, positive and negative, etc., then truly, this would be the language of life, for, as he thought, God the Creator was represented as 1, while the void was represented as 0.</span></p><p><span>At the same time, he was inventing this </span><em><span>divine math</span></em><span> meant to explore the hidden secrets of reality, he was inventing the first mechanical calculator suitable not only for addition and subtraction but for multiplication as well. His dream was to make a logical thinking</span>
<span>device.</span><sup><a href='#43'><span>43</span></a></sup></p><p><span>Leibniz was creating tools for exoteric and esoteric understanding, both based on the same logic, but giving two very different answers.</span></p><p><span>Some years later, in the middle of the 20th century, a group of modern-day holy men from the western world (called scientists), were building the first digital computer. To synopsize the entire digital revolution into one paragraph, imagine one of these gurus saying: “I&#39;ve got an idea. Let&#39;s develop a component that will act as a conductor when a certain amount of voltage is passed through it, and an insulator when no voltage is passed through it. We will call this component a ‘gate&#39;. Because this gate can only respond to one of two states, high or low voltage, yes or no, so to speak, which represents the most basic principles of reasoning, we will call it a ‘logic gate.&#39; Any problem that can be reduced into so many yes-or-no conditions can be calculated by these logic gates. We can use the numbers 1 and 0 to represent these states. Because the heart of these electronic machines will be made up of these yes-or-no circuits, we will call them ‘</span><em><span>digital circuits.”</span></em><span> … and the digital computer as we know it today was invented.</span></p><p><span>If Leibniz was alive today to see his sacred binary math of 1s and 0s being used to usher in the greatest transformation of knowledge ever known to Man he would recognize it as both a tool of practical use as well as a tool of great esoteric potential, a key to the secret knowledge he was looking for.</span></p><p><span>This story of Leibniz&#39;s divine math as well as his simultaneous discovery of calculus, which was shared with Isaac Newton, lends some credence to the hypothesis that ideas are the leading expressions of the same forces that brought life, the universe and everything into being, and as such, they have a life of their own and their own intelligence. We like to think we come up with ideas, but perhaps this is no truer than a flower ‘deciding&#39; to change colors when exposed to more light, or a river ‘deciding&#39; to change course because the wolf population has</span>
<span>increased.</span><sup><a href='#44'><span>44</span></a></sup></p><p><span>Although currently not a mainstream theory, the understanding that Ideas are more like expressions of living intelligences that we have a symbiotic relationship with is currently alive and well, and has been around for thousands of years. Traditionally these forms of intelligence and intention were anthropomorphized into deities, angels, demons, spirits, etc., and it was understood that we use them for our purposes, noble and otherwise, and they use us for their purposes, noble or otherwise. Today we have new, evidenced based hypotheses of this same concept in the forms of panpsychism, morphic fields, collective (un)consciousness, Universal mind, etc.</span></p><p><span>From a one perspective, all forms of life are simply instances of various Ideas.</span></p><p><span>One of the fundamental differences in how similar concepts evolve over time is in what and how structure is applied to the idea. Take for example the idea of the biblical creation story vs. reality-as-a-simulation hypothesis. We can see by their similarity that they are clearly the same concept, but one filtered and defined through the belief structures of Judeo-Christian doctrine and the other through the stricture of reason that is modern science.</span></p><p><span>The above was a somewhat circuitous route to get to this point of looking at the most fundamental structure of knowledge that is not only the basis of reason but the basis of existence as well.</span></p><h3><a name="language" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Language</span></h3><p><span>In the realm of ideas, the most important tool that man has deployed has been language. Language transmits the reasoning behind ideas; it is how ideas evolve, how they are destroyed and how they defend themselves (which, according to Dawkins, they do, as he explains in his book “The Selfish Gene”). As such, we would expect to see language embedded with the same structure as that of ideas and concepts.</span></p><p><span>Humans are sort of stuck with the language we have been using for thousands of years, and if we were to (and when we do) invent a new language today it would look radically different.</span></p><p><span>In 1968, Aristid Lindenmayer, a Hungarian theoretical biologist, and botanist at the University of Utrecht designed a symbolic language call </span><em><span>L-system</span></em><span> that incorporated various symbols that were bound by a set of rules. He developed this language as a way to model and describe the behavior of plants and a variety of other organisms</span><sup><a href='#45'><span>45</span></a></sup><span>. The philosophy and architecture of the language were based on the observed logic of growth, i.e. life. Not coincidently, this language describes self-similar systems. This is the language of the future, but sadly, only for our digital offspring, at least not until we do some major rewiring upstairs.</span></p><center><img src="../Images/043-l-system-trees.png" style="width:5.52778in" alt="frac-trees.png"></center><p><span>Still, human language is surprisingly efficient and still manages to function with the same structure that naturally exists in ideas and concepts. Its efficiency is not so much in how language itself evolved, but our brain&#39;s ability to apply context and instantly run through many interpretations of words and sentence structure until it finds the most applicable interpretation.</span></p><p><span>Take the following sentence:</span></p><p><em><span>I can&#39;t untie that knot with one hand.</span></em></p><p><span>The meanings of words, their order, the context of who is speaking and where they are, and many other details, come into play to turn that sentence into information in our head.</span></p><p><span>But language itself is messy. Were language more structured we might say this sentence as</span></p><p><span>Not </span><span>[</span><span>I </span><span>[</span><span>Able </span><span>[</span><span>[</span><span>[</span><span>Make </span><span>[</span><span>Not </span><span>[</span><span>Tied</span><span>]</span><span>]</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>That knot</span><span>]</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>With One Hand</span><span>]</span><span>]</span><span>]</span><span>]</span></p><p><span>There is such a language which was developed to specifically optimize the transmissions of concepts.

Semantics is the branch of linguistics and logic concerned with meaning, but there are two kinds of meaning, according to the Theory of</span>
<span>Meaning</span><sup><a href='#47'><span>47</span></a></sup><span>. The first kind is the more common definition of semantics.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>The description of possible languages or grammars as abstract semantic systems whereby symbols are associated with aspects of the world. (a more objective view)</span></p></blockquote><p><span>The second kind is more relative.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>The description of the psychological and sociological facts whereby a particular one of these abstract semantic systems is the one used by a person or population. (contextual relevance)</span></p></blockquote><p><span>The </span><em><span>semantic web</span></em><span> is an Internet based project that applies these concepts in an attempt to define what information is in a manner that is structured so that computers can read data and know if it is information and more importantly, why it is information. It does this by creating a relationship (called a predicate) between two things (called objects).</span></p><p><span>Take the example of the following sentence:</span></p><p><span>“Bob is interested in the Mona Lisa.”</span></p><p><span>To a human, this is information because we know how to parse this sentence into meaning. That is what learning to speak is all about. To a computer, however, it is just a meaningless collection of 1s and 0s.</span></p><p><span>If we break this sentence up into three parts and define each part in a way that software can understand, then a computer can attempt to find meaning in it. For example, we can tell the computer that we have two “things”, “</span><em><span>Bob”</span></em><span> and “</span><em><span>Mona Lisa”</span></em><span>, and one “relationship”, “</span><em><span>is interested in”</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>With these three data points, three “atoms” or data, we have the simplest form of information, an information “molecule”, so to speak. The “things” are called </span><em><span>objects</span></em><span>, and the “relationship” is called a </span><em><span>predicate</span></em><span>. Together they are called a </span><em><span>triplet</span></em><span>. We may have some other triplets about Bob, such as, he is a person, he is a friend of Alice, etc.… and we can bind these triplets together quite naturally.</span></p><center><img src="../Images/045-monalisa.jpg" style="width:4.67639in;height:3.125in" alt="example-graph.jpg"></center><p><span>Predicates can be just about anything… “lives in”, “has a”, “enjoys”, etc. Objects, however, are part of much larger, more structured hierarchies, much like the holarchies above.</span></p><p><span>We can graph the previous sentence as well in something like the following:</span></p><center><img src="../Images/046-handknot.png" style="width:2.66667in;height:2.66667in"></center><p><span>How does a computer know what </span><em><span>is interested in</span></em><span> or what a </span><em><span>person</span></em><span> is? It doesn&#39;t “know” the way you or I know, but it does know that a </span><em><span>person</span></em><span> is a type of </span><em><span>agent</span></em><span>, has a </span><em><span>family name</span></em><span>, a </span><em><span>first name</span></em><span> and that a person </span><em><span>knows things</span></em><span>. So, as far as a computer is concerned, a person is just a dataset with a bunch of specific properties and relationship to other</span>
<span>datasets.</span><sup><a href='#48'><span>48</span></a></sup><span> These definitions and relationships are defined in a hierarchical manner and are called </span><em><span>ontologies</span></em><span>. There are thousands of these ontologies of definitions run by corporations, governments, individuals, schools, the military, etc., that cover an incredible array of data in areas of geography, life sciences, linguistics, media, social networking, medicine, catfish, diseases, road-maps, accommodations in Tuscany, etc.… and they can all talk to each other by linking </span><em><span>triplets</span></em>
<span>together</span><em><span>.</span></em><sup><a href='#49'><span>49</span></a></sup></p><p><span>As you can imagine, very quickly a computer can create millions of connections.</span></p><p><span>With all these connections, we can ask the computer typical questions like “</span><em><span>How many romantic comedy Hollywood movies are directed by a person who is born in a city that has an average temperature above 15 degrees?</span></em><span>” Of course, social media companies, who have their own data that they aggressively collect from their users, can ask questions like “</span><em><span>Give me a list of all the boys who are eligible to vote in the next election, and who listen to a certain type of music and have friends and family that are of a certain political persuasion.</span></em><span>” More worrying are the queries of the near future, such as “</span><em><span>Tell me all the names of people that are likely to commit a crime in the next week.</span></em><span>” That may sound like paranoia about a dystopian future, but AI systems in China have an 80% success rate in predicting who is a criminal just by looking at them. At Stanford University they have developed AI that has a 91% accuracy rate of determining if you are gay or straight</span><sup><a href='#50'><span>50</span></a></sup><span>… and that is just the beginning.</span></p><p><span>The point of this is simply to show that knowledge and information are based on not only concepts of things, but also concepts of how those things relate to one another.

Furthermore, we claim that these three primitives are essentially three different perspectives of one hyper-dimensional state that can only be expressed as multiple space-time states. An example of this is how the hyper-dimensional state of electricity (which itself is only one expression of energy out of many) is expressed as four space-time states of volts, ohms, amps, and power, with any three capable of describing the fourth. These 3+1 primitives are represented as a tetrahedron or tholon.  We go even further and claim that the 3+1 dimensions of our reality (X,Y,Z, + time), is itself the most fundamental expression of this same modal.  </span></p><h2><a name="info-atoms" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Info-atoms</span></h2><p><span>If our premise is that the smallest element of knowledge must conform to the same laws as the smallest elements of form, conceptually speaking, then we need to show how these 2D models, such as the holarchy, fit into a not just a 3D model, but specifically tetrahedral structures that represent “knowledge molecules” with a ordered self-similar hierarchy where each holon is represented as a tetrahedral of information.</span></p><p><span>Our revised model of hierarchical tetrahedrons will surely look and act differently than a holarchy. To avoid confusion, we&#39;ll refer these </span><em><span>tetrahedron holons</span></em><span> as </span><em><span>tholons</span></em><span> (for obvious reasons), and the holarchy and as </span><em><span>thologram</span></em><span> (a combination of </span><em><span>tholon</span></em><span> and </span><em><span>hologram</span></em><span>).</span></p><h4><a name="claim-41-every-tholon-is-an-archetype" class="md-header-anchor"></a><strong><span>Claim 41:</span></strong><span> Every tholon is an archetype. </span></h4><p><span>We are working from the premise that everything that exists is a product of a stable pattern existing between different states. The simplest concept of such a duality is that of </span><em><span>something</span></em><span> and </span><em><span>nothing</span></em><span>. In the realm of ideas and form, this is very easy to imagine. OK, maybe the idea of a void of absolute nothingness is a bit much to grasp. As for </span><em><span>something,</span></em><span> we don&#39;t need to imagine something that represents everything at once, which is not only beyond our ability, but as everything that yet to come into existence, it is impossible. On the contrary, we only need to imagine the simplest form of something, for example, a singular dot. A simple dot on a blank page is a diagram of the model on which this reality, and all knowledge, is based.</span></p><p><span>This simplest of concepts explains the holarchy, tetrahedrons, magic crystals, all the laws of physics and every form of intelligence in existence.</span></p><h3><a name="geometry-i" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Geometry I</span></h3><p><span>The simplest way we can describe this process of emergence from a dot to everything in existence also happens to be the most effective way, and that is with the language of geometry.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>“Philosophy </span><span>[</span><span>nature</span><span>]</span><span> is written in that great book whichever is before our eyes -- I mean the universe -- but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols in which it is written. The book is written in mathematical language, and the symbols are triangles, circles, and other geometrical figures, without whose help it is impossible to comprehend a single word of it; without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth.”</span></p></blockquote><h5><a name="galileo-galilee-1564-1642" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>~</span><span>Galileo Galilee, 1564-1642</span></h5><blockquote><p><span>“It is the glory of geometry that from so few principles, fetched from without, it is able to accomplish so much. &quot;</span></p></blockquote><h5><a name="sir-isaac-newton" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>~</span><span>Sir Isaac Newton</span></h5><p><img src="../Images/050-dot-line-tri.jpg" style="float:right;width:1.57778in;height:0.39861in" /><span>We are taught that the progression from point to tetrahedron follows a very clear and simple path of point → line → trigram → tetrahedron.</span></p><p><span>From the tholonic perspective, this is a very incomplete description because it considers any point to be just like any other point, but they are not the same, as each point has very different attributes. If we ignore those attributes, we are blind to what geometry can show us about so much more than shapes.</span></p><center><img src="../Images/051-firstdot.png" style="width:90%"></center><p><span>We start with a 0-dimensional </span><em><span>dot</span></em><span> (0 dimensions because nothing yet exists) represented by a blue dot in the middle of nothing </span><em><span>(Fig. c1)</span></em><span>. Because it is 0 dimensions and surrounded by nothing, it only exists as a concept of </span><em><span>something</span></em><span>. It has no form, no dimensions, no properties other than that it is a </span><em><span>concept</span></em><span> of </span><em><span>something</span></em><span> that exists. But where does it exist? It can&#39;t be measured, seen, or interacted with in any way, so how can we say it even exists? This dot exists only as a concept, which means it only exists because of the awareness of its existence. The only difference between a void of nothingness and a void of nothingness with an imaginary point in it is the idea of an imaginary point in a void of nothingness. Without the awareness of its existence, the void of nothingness would simply remain a void of nothingness.</span></p><p><span>This next step requires some philosophical conjecture because we have to ask why/how does a 2</span><sup><span>nd</span></sup><span> (green), dot appear </span><em><span>(Fig. c2).</span></em></p><p><span>If we accept the premise that everything that is created has the attributes of, and limitations of, whatever created it, then, the answer is clear and simple. As this lone imaginary dot in the middle of infinite nothingness only exists as an awareness of the concept of a point in the middle of infinite nothingness, the attribute this point </span><em><span>can</span></em><span> have is … awareness.</span></p><p><span>There is one more attribute it has as well that is far less obvious, and that is </span><em><span>intention</span></em><span>, because whatever awareness conceived of a point in nothingness had to have the intention to conceive if it. So, our point in the middle of infinite nothingness has two attributes; awareness and intention.</span></p><p><span>This may sound like we&#39;re teetering on the edge of mysticism, but this is not our goal. We simply are following the most reasonable path that our ability to understand our reality allows. The fact that it shows that all of existence is a form of awareness that is ever becoming aware of itself is not mysticism, it is reality. Science is slowly beginning to consider that there might be a relationship between awareness and reality, but at some point, it will be common knowledge that awareness is not only the fabric of reality, but it is also the energy that drives all of creation and the most powerful energy in existence.</span></p><h4><a name="claim-xx-the-tholonic-definition-of-energy-is-the-balancing-of-an-ever-bifurcating-awareness-in-accordance-with-the-laws-of-duality" class="md-header-anchor"></a><strong><span>Claim XX:</span></strong><span> The tholonic definition of energy is “the balancing of an ever bifurcating awareness in accordance with the laws of duality.”</span></h4><p><span>So, our first dot has two attributes, awareness and intention, and one limitation of 0-dimensions. This dot then is itself a form of awareness and being so, it will be aware of the existence of </span><em><span>dotness</span></em><span>, not </span><em><span>its dotness</span></em><span>, just </span><em><span>a dotness</span></em><span>. Just as the awareness of a conceptual point created the first dot, the first dot&#39;s awareness of dotness is what creates the 2</span><sup><span>nd</span></sup><span> (green) dot, and in doing so, creates the 1</span><sup><span>st</span></sup><span> instance of a dimension. With two dots, we now have a relationship between them as shown by a line </span><em><span>(Fig. c3)</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>Each of these dots is aware of </span><em><span>its</span></em><span> dotness now, not just </span><em><span>a</span></em><span> dotness, because, with the existence of the other dot, each dot now has a center of its awareness </span><em><span>(Fig. c4)</span></em><span>, and the other dot defining its opposite and the limits of its awareness </span><em><span>(Fig. c5)</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>As both dots are aware of their own dotness and of the other&#39;s dotness they are also aware of where these two opposite awareness&#39;s interact. These points of intersecting awareness are the (red) 3</span><sup><span>rd</span></sup><span> dot and 4</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span> dot.</span></p><p><span>We use the colors of blue, green and red to symbolize the attributes of these dots. Here they are described and listed in their order of instantiation.</span></p><figure><table><thead><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>&nbsp;</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img src="../Images/dot-blue.png" style="width:220px;float:left"/></td><td><span>The 1</span><sup><span>st</span></sup><span> dot.

The 2</span><sup><span>nd</span></sup><span> green dot represents the first-generation dot created by the blue dot. This dot can add 1 dimension a 0-dimension and defines separation and division. This dot also defines the idea of self-awareness as a result of a state of awareness with respect to another state of awareness.</span></td></tr><tr><td><img src="../Images/dot-red.png" style="width:220px;float:left"/></td><td><span>The 3</span><sup><span>rd</span></sup><span> dot. The red dots represent where the blue dot and the green dot connect. These are always created in pairs and represent the opposite states of blue dot-green dot interactions. This dot can add 1 dimension to an existing 1-dimensional space and defines scope and area as a result of the union.</span></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><span>Now a perfect trigram exists, but so do three others. It seems we can&#39;t make just one trigram without three additional trigrams instantly coming into existence, and this applies to the additional trigrams as well. Instantly we have an infinite loop of self-similarity. From the tholonic perspective, the instantiation of this concept of instant expansion was experienced when an atom-sized point representing all matter in existence instantly expanded to fill the universe, at least according to the Big Bang Theory.</span></p><p><span>This ever-expanding conceptual model, however, is imprisoned in the 2D world forever because even though it can make an infinite number of 2D dots, it cannot make a new 3D dot. Why can&#39;t the same process that was used to create 2D from 1D be used to create 3D from 2D, by just creating another dot with another dimension?</span></p><p><span>The reason is as follows: There can only be three types of dots in the 2D world because that is the minimum number of dots required to define an area. If we added a new 4</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span> type of dot that was also constrained to the 2D world, whatever area it creates could be defined using three dots just as well, so, this 4</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span> dot adds no new information and is useless. We need a completely new type of dot that is compatible with all three types of dots.</span></p><p><span>Not surprisingly, the trigrams have already given us the answer with the following two clues. The first clue is that the creation of one trigram implies the creation of three additional opposite or mirror image trigrams, each one connected to each side of the center trigram. The second clue is that for each of these new mirror trigrams a new dot is created. These three new dots at the outer edge of the new trigrams are each of a different color. As every trigram must be composed of three unique dots (R, G, and B), and as a new type of dot capable of creating a 3D tetrahedron from the trigram would automatically create three new trigrams, whatever dot type this new dot is, it would have to act as a red dot to the blue-green pair of the original trigram, a blue dot to the green-red pair, and a green dot to the red-blur pair.</span></p><p><span>Looking at </span><em><span>Fig. c8</span></em><span> we see that these are exactly the types of dots that have been created; one blue, one green and one red. All we need to do to combine these three dots together in a new dot, and </span><em><span>viola</span></em><span>, we have a new dot type that can create the 3</span><sup><span>rd</span></sup><span> dimension.</span></p><p><span>The RGB </span><img src="../Images/052-rgbdot.png" style="width:0.23in;height:0.23in" /><span> or White dot </span><img src="../Images/053-whitedot.png" style="width:0.233in;height:0.233in" /><span>represents the combination of all three primary dots. This dot can add 1 dimension to 2-dimensions and defines volumes as a result of the union of three unique trigrams.</span></p><p><span>We now have a tetrahedron.</span></p><p><span>We can easily demonstrate this by simply folding the three mirrored trigrams up until their three points meet. The folding occurs naturally because it represents the most balanced and efficient interaction between a set of four unique dots (R, G, B, W), and as energy will always travel the path of least resistance, folding would naturally occur.</span></p><h2><a name="holons-to-tholons" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Holons to Tholons</span></h2><p><span>Let&#39;s apply some of the semantic concepts to the holarchy as it will shed more light on the nature of information and how a holarchy forms a network of trinities in the way these holons interact with one another.</span></p><p><span>We begin with a simple trigram.</span></p><p><span>According to the authors, each holon has three functions:</span></p><ul><li><span>Contributes (upwards relationship)</span></li><li><span>Negotiates (sideways relationship)</span></li><li><span>Defines (below relationship)</span></li></ul><p><em><span>For the record, the original definitions, and the ones used by Velikovsky in his work were “A holon looks up for what it needs to integrate with, looks sideways for what it needs to compete &amp;/or cooperate with, looks down for what it needs to control.” These definitions were modified in the tholon not only to reflect a more holistic type of relationship but also because these updated definitions were more in line with real-world test cases.</span></em></p><p><img src="../Images/054-holonrel1.png" style="width:3.6375in;height:1.76389in" alt="Presentation3.png" /></p><p><span>These attributes hold up quite well when compared to our real-world example of a supply chain.</span></p><ul><li><span>Production (what it contributes)</span></li><li><span>Trade (negotiations, cooperation or competition, exchange of resources)</span></li><li><span>Consumption (limits, or definitions, of resources)</span></li></ul><p><span>You can also easily see how the above relationships can be described semantically as two objects (the holons) that have a relationship with via a predicates </span><em><span>define, contribute,</span></em><span> and </span><em><span>negotiate</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>To further give this idea a test run, let&#39;s apply this to something completely arbitrary, such as batteries.</span></p><p><span>We can also visually represent the relationships in the following manner, which allows us to easily map this to a trigram:</span></p><p><img src="../Images/055-holonrel2.png" style="width:3.77292in;height:1.51111in" alt="Presentation2.png" /></p><h2><a name="tholograms" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Tholograms</span></h2><h3><a name="geometry-ii" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Geometry II</span></h3><p><img src="../Images/056-NDCpoints.png" style="float:right;width:2.54583in;height:2.34167in" /><span>Let&#39;s take these three relationship attributes of </span><strong><span>C</span></strong><span>ontributes, </span><strong><span>N</span></strong><span>egotiates, and </span><strong><span>D</span></strong><span>efines (which we&#39;ll shorten to just C, N, and D) and map them to the three points of a trigram.</span></p><p><span>How do we know what attribute maps to what point? Further on we will show a more complete argument, but for now we can simply say if we have a parent, a child and a peer, as we do in both the holarchy and thologram, the parent would be the 1</span><sup><span>st</span></sup><span> point, the child the 2</span><sup><span>nd</span></sup><span> point, and the peer the 3</span><sup><span>rd</span></sup><span> point, as shown in the figure on the right.</span></p><p><span>Why are we just mapping the relationship properties? Here&#39;s why:</span></p><p><span>In the holarchy, the </span><em><span>types of elements</span></em><span> are Parent, Peer, or Child, and the properties of </span><strong><span>C</span></strong><span>ontributes, </span><strong><span>N</span></strong><span>egotiates and </span><strong><span>D</span></strong><span>efines describe the relationships between these types. Our trigram is defined by the </span><em><span>properties</span></em><span> of the holons (</span><em><span>Fig. t2 below</span></em><span>), not the types of holons. We could have just as easily defined a trigram of the </span><em><span>types of elements</span></em><span> alone, as shown below (</span><em><span>Fig. t1</span></em><span>). In fact, this is typically how hierarchies are organized. In our case, however, we are using the properties, not the types, because the movement of energy is in these property archetypes, not in the elements themselves, which are the expressions of these properties.</span></p><p><span>Although we are using this idea of energy and movement as the foundations of reality, this is not a new idea. The </span><em><span>Reciprocal System theory</span></em><span> is built on the same premise and provides the best explanation of why we are using the movement of energy in the relationships and not the contexts of where that energy is coming from or going to.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>The thesis of the Reciprocal System, however, is that the universe is not a universe of matter, but a universe of motion, one in which the basic reality is motion, and all entities—photons, particles, atoms, fields, forces, and all forms of energy—are merely manifestations of</span>
<span>motion.</span><sup><a href='#51'><span>51</span></a></sup></p></blockquote><p><span>Like every theory, it has its fans, but also its critics. In any case, it applies perfectly here.</span></p><p><span>Newton&#39;s Laws of Motion are similar in this regard, as the laws of motion describe the energy that relates to mass, not mass itself. Because of this we can show a direct relationship between these tholonic concept and Newton&#39;s laws:</span></p><p><strong><span>Newton&#39;s 3</span><sup><span>rd</span></sup><span> law states</span></strong><span> “</span><em><span>For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.</span></em><span>” This equates to </span><strong><span>Balance.</span></strong><span> No mass energy is defined here, just as no dimension in defined in the 1</span><sup><span>st</span></sup><span> dot. This law only describes the result of existing energies acting against each other, associating it with the 1</span><sup><span>st</span></sup><span> “blue dot” realm of </span><strong><span>Negotiation</span></strong><span>.</span></p><p><strong><span>Newton&#39;s 2</span><sup><span>nd</span></sup><span> law states</span></strong><span> </span><em><span>“Force equals mass times acceleration.”</span></em><span> F</span><strong><span>orce</span></strong><span> is the result of time and space (acceleration and mass), so it is within the realm of the 3</span><sup><span>rd</span></sup><span> “red dot”, scope and area, and tholonically is within the realm of </span><strong><span>Contribution</span></strong><span>, as it creates a new concept that describes the movement of energy, that being force, which is unlike balance, being the result of energies interacting, and inertia, being the restrictions on mass without energy.</span></p><p><strong><span>Newton&#39;s 1</span><sup><span>st</span></sup><span> law states</span></strong><span> </span><em><span>“Every object in a state of uniform motion will remain in that state of motion unless an external force acts on it.”</span></em><span> This law introduces the concept of an instance of mass, putting in the realm of the 2</span><sup><span>nd</span></sup><span> “green dot”, and its limitations. Its inability to move or change without an external forcing acting upon it puts it in the tholonic realm of </span><strong><span>Definition.</span></strong></p><p><span>Tholonically speaking, Newton&#39;s Law of Motions should be in the following order:</span></p><ol start='' ><li><em><span>For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction (Newton&#39;s 3</span><sup><span>rd</span></sup><span> law)</span></em></li><li><em><span>Every object in a state of uniform motion will remain in that state of motion unless an external force acts on it.

There may be millions of instances of things within the holarchy, from subatomic elements to universal elements, and everything in between, but the properties are always the same, even though they are expressed differently for each context. Therefore, it is the properties that define the structure of the hierarchy, not the elements.</span></p><p><span>These properties direct energy, energy has movement, and movement has direction. In this example the direction is clear, however, this direction could change under different circumstances as we&#39;ll see later on.</span></p><center><img src="../Images/057-NDCpoints-rels.png" style="width:90%"></center><p><span>To further illustrate this point, we can use the semantic example above where we show “Alice </span><em><span>is a friend of</span></em><span> Bob.” The thologram model looks at </span><em><span>is a friend of</span></em><span> as the energetic force that defines Alice and Bob, at least within this narrow context of </span><em><span>friendship</span></em><span>. Without relationships Alive and Bob would not even exist, as these relationships define every interaction down to the atomic level.</span></p><p><span>Now that we have mapped the three properties of N, C, and D onto a trigram we can see and label a new class of attributes that are the result of these properties interacting with each other. For example, what would we expect to see across a spectrum that is defined at one end as Negotiation, and at the opposite end, Definition? In the context of human interactions (just to keep it simple and clear), this pretty much describes how we agree on laws, rules, and limits. Across the spectrum of Definition and Contributions, we would see how existing systems and new systems get along with each other, which would be some form of cooperation or conflict. On the spectrum of Contribution and Negotiation, we would see some sort of value returned to the society or culture, perhaps in the forms of fealty, dedication, or service (</span><em><span>Fig. t3</span></em><span>).</span></p><center><img src="../Images/058-interrules.png" style="width:40%"></center><p><span>For the purposes of demonstration, we&#39;ll use these ideas going forward, but keep in mind these are just a few archetypal examples out of many, and only limited to one context. Across different contexts, they would be described differently.</span></p><ul><li><strong><span>Laws, rules, and limits</span></strong><span> resulting from </span><em><span>Negotiation and Definition</span></em><span>.</span></li><li><strong><span>Cooperation of conflict</span></strong><span> resulting from </span><em><span>Definition and Contribution</span></em><span>.</span></li><li><strong><span>Fealty, dedication, service</span></strong><span> resulting from </span><em><span>Contribution and Negotiation</span></em><span>.</span></li></ul><p><span>It is important to note that in the first example when we used the three points of Parent, Child, and Peer, these elements are static, and their relationships of Negotiation, Definition, and Contribution are dynamic. Now when we use Negotiation, Definition, and Contribution as the three points, the relations between them is once again static. Were we to go further and use the three new static concepts as points we would again have relationships that were dynamic. This reversing back and forth between static and dynamic with each generation is a natural consequence of the creative process, as will see in more detail a bit further down.</span></p><h4><a name="claim-43-static-instances-form-dynamic-relationships-dynamic-relationships-form-static-instances" class="md-header-anchor"></a><strong><span>Claim 43</span></strong><span>: Static instances form dynamic relationships. Dynamic relationships form static instances</span></h4><p><img src="../Images/059-ruleexposure.png" style="float:right;width:40%" /><span>Here we show the three points of N, D, and C as color sources that instantiate on the scopes, or lines, opposite them. Think of each point as ever-expanding light that illuminates the ‘wall&#39; opposite it. This is a much more complete idea of a tholon as it shows the tholonic concept as the sum of all the attributes (exemplified by the white trigram in the middle), with the points as archetypes, and the lines as the field, zone or scope of where new types of archetypes can emerge from.</span></p><p><span>We now have a completed trigram that describes the movement of energy in the process of creation. What would be the simplest instance of this trigram? Most likely it would be something like an atom, the first instance of matter, with a neutral (N), positive (C), and negative (D) particle. This is the description of hydrogen, the very first atom created, with one neutron, one proton, and one electron, the most abundant element in the universe and </span><img src="../Images/060-exag-bell-curve.png" style="float:left;width:1.56667in;height:2.35347in" /><span>from which every other element that exists is created from. On the biological level, this describes mitosis, the process of cell duplication, or reproduction, where one cell gives rise to two genetically identical daughter cells. In the realm of philosophy, we have the Hegelian Dialectic of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. In fact, for a tholonic concept to exist as a potentially viable and sustainable expression it must satisfy a form of the Hegelian Dialectic, in that it must support a thesis (D), antithesis (C), and synthesis (N).</span></p><p><span>We can learn a number of things from this trigram, but the one detail that is important before moving on is that the N-point is the originating point. This point represents a state of patterned energy that is sustainable and capable of propagating itself. We call this an N-state or an N-source.</span></p><h3><a name="house-of-mirrors" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>House of Mirrors</span></h3><p><span>The tholographic claim is that within the trigram there is energy, and therefore movement, and therefore patterns and oscillations from which stable states will arise that are sustainable enough to form a new N-state that is capable of transferring energy across the scope defined by C and D. Even though one particular state will exist at one specific point on the 1-dimensional line between C and D, all possible states will cover the entire range between C and D. We can generally guess where along the line various states will arise by applying a Bell curve between C and D, as shown.</span></p><p><span>We can now say this about the trigram and its properties:</span></p><ul><li><strong><span>N</span></strong><span> (negotiation) equates to the 1</span><sup><span>st</span></sup><span> blue dot</span><img src="../Images/dot-blue.png" style="width:50px"/><span>, which is the awareness of a concept in its simplest form.</span></li><li><strong><span>D</span></strong><span> (definition) equates to the 2</span><sup><span>nd</span></sup><span> green dot</span><img src="../Images/dot-green.png" style="width:50px"/><span>, which introduced limitation, division, and separation.</span></li><li><strong><span>C</span></strong><span> (contribution) equates to the 3</span><sup><span>rd</span></sup><span> red dot</span><img src="../Images/dot-red.png" style="width:50px"/><span>, which, with the previous two dots, resulted in unification and form.</span></li></ul><p><span>By these descriptions, we can state as a general process that defines creations is something like:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>The successful joining of contrasting concepts (Negotiation) finding expression in form (Contribution) through limitation, division, and separation (Definition).</span></p></blockquote><p><span>At the most abstract levels, this describes the Big Bang Theory, biological reproduction, the laws of physics, philosophy, and anything else that exists in any sort of duality. Of course, this definition is so broad that it is easy to apply it to anything.</span></p><h3><a name="inner-not-outer" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Inner, not Outer</span></h3><p><span>We have seen how the creation of a single trigram will automatically create addition trigrams as part of the same creative process, so where are all those additional trigrams? If the first trigram represents the first moment of creation and its limits of total somethingness and total nothingness, then everything that follows must exist </span><em><span>within</span></em><span> the first trigram, not outside of it. The result is contrary to </span><em><span>Fig. c9</span></em><span>, which shows the ever outwardly expanding self-similarity. The model presented here would require that newly created self-similar trigrams must exist </span><em><span>within</span></em><span> the boundaries of the first trigram.</span></p><p><span>This is the same process of how the addition of a green dot automatically created two opposing red dots that defined the limits of the blue dot. Here we are only showing the central trigram, but for every trigram shown, there is an opposite or mirror trigram created as well.</span></p><p><span>When trigrams are created inside a trigram, something else happens… two additional N points are created. This will become a very important detail shortly.</span></p><center><img src="../Images/061-tri-to-tho.png" style="width:80%"></center><p><span>In this example diagram </span><em><span>Fig. p1</span></em><span> above, the outermost N, D, C points represent the first trigram. You&#39;ll see in </span><em><span>Fig. p2</span></em><span> on the CD line of this parent trigram a new state was formed, N. It naturally bifurcates and expands in the same manner as its parent until it reaches its limits of the boundaries of the parent and in doing so creates two additional trigrams.</span></p><p><span>You may also notice what looks like an inconsistency in the order of the letters. </span><em><span>In Fig. p1,</span></em><span> the parent trigram, the order is (clockwise) NDC, but the three points of the resulting trigram are NCD. It&#39;s not actually a reordering, as the children trigrams represent completely new creations. The original NDC is still there in the parent, but we are only looking at the children in </span><em><span>Fig. p2</span></em><span>. The reason the children have a different order is because the new generation was spawned by the new N-source between C and D, and as D is always the first to follow N, and always on the left of N (left is arbitrary, but we need to remain consistent), the newly spawned D will appear on the opposite side of the parent&#39;s D. The same applies to C. Not coincidently, this new top trigram has the exact same order and position of the parent. The parent always creates a smaller replica of itself in each generation. You&#39;ll also notice that each of the outer trigrams is a mirrored copy of the one central trigram.</span></p><p><span>We started with one trigram, created one more, resulting in 4 trigrams. Each generation of self-similar creation increases the number of trigrams by 4. Here is what the generations look like.</span></p><center><img src="../Images/062-4generations.png" style="width:90%"></center><p><span>In the 1</span><sup><span>st</span></sup><span> generation of a simple trigram, we see a few fundamental rules, such as:</span></p><ul><li><span>All sides are of equal length</span></li><li><span>Every point is connected to every other point.</span></li><li><span>Two points define a line, three points define a trigram. (seems super obvious now, but wait…)</span></li><li><span>The area of the trigram is known.  </span><em><strong><span>(</span></strong><span>SQRT(num-of- sides)/(num-of-sides+1)</span><strong><span>)</span></strong><span> x length-of-side</span><sup><span>2</span></sup></em></li><li><span>The radius of the incircle is exactly half the radius of the circumcircle</span></li><li><span>The end-point where any two lines meet is always the middle of the line formed by the two adjacent points.</span></li><li><span>The total number of degrees of the angles equals half the total degrees of a circle. This is especially significant later.</span></li></ul><p><span>We also see a few other interesting details, such as, how the contribution of red divides the green (on the right side). Can we say the same thing for how green is what divided the red, such as it appears on the left side? No, because there is an order to the points of blue &gt; green &gt; red, so green existed </span><em><span>before</span></em><span> red, therefore the introduction of the 3</span><sup><span>rd</span></sup><span> red point must divide the already existing 2</span><sup><span>nd</span></sup><span> green point. Likewise, the green&#39;s boundaries are defined and limited by the red (on the left side) using the same logic that the green came first and the red followed.</span></p><p><span>In the world of mathematics, this is similar to something called a </span><em><span>Sierpinski Triangle</span></em><span>, which is also a self-similar triangle. This is significant as the Sierpinski Triangle has many real-world applications, such as broadband antennas, musical composition, mathematics, chemistry and is a foundational pattern in nature.</span></p><p><span>The difference between the thologram and the Sierpinski Triangle is in the latter the concept of a triangle is considered at a separate object that is always upright, so when it is duplicated there is a triangular ‘hole&#39; in the middle where no triangle exists … like this:</span></p><center><img src="../Images/063-serp.png" style="width:90%"></center><p><span>In the thologram, we consider the triangle not as an object, but as the boundaries that constrain the movement of energy. The fact that the center trigram is a mirror of the three outer trigrams is evidence of the significance of this inner trigram. One way to think about the thologram is the boundaries are like one-way mirrors, reflecting the light (energy) within the triangle, but allowing the light from outside to enter. This difference between the thologram and the Sierpinski Triangle is only conceptual because the math is essentially the same, but the thologram considers the negative or empty space just as valid as the filled space, just with different attributes.</span></p><p><span>With each generation, we have more and more rules. In just a few generations we see two dominant patterns begin to emerge from these rules. The first one being the Fibonacci sequence, which emerges simply by the linear increase in generation count as well as the number of trigrams for each generation (1,4,16…), which is always 4^</span><sup><span>generation</span></sup><span>.</span></p><p><img src="../Images/064-hexagram.png" style="float:right;width:2.04792in;height:1.74167in" /><span>The second dominant pattern is the hexagon, one of nature&#39;s most persistent and useful shapes, and can be seen in beehives, Saturn&#39;s north pole, dragonfly eyes, rocks, bubbles, snowflakes, organic chemistry, etc., etc., but it is much more than just that. We are also shown how the N-sources converge to form the center every hexagon. From this, we get a much better idea as to the nature of N-sources, which are, unsurprisingly, at the center of order. This is important because it gives us an insight into answering the question “Where did the first N-source come from?”</span></p><p><span>We also see that every </span><em><span>Define</span></em><span> or </span><em><span>Contribute</span></em><span> point is naturally paired with its opposite.</span></p><p><span>Another interesting observation are those little black dots in the middle of the lines. Why are they important?</span></p><p><span>Those black dots mark the center of a line that has the capability of creating new children (stable patterns), or N-sources. You&#39;ll notice that those lines only exist on the outer ring of the hexagon.</span></p><p><span>As we saw earlier, the N-source (blue) is the progenitor of the subsequent D (green) and C (red) dots. We also know that the N must always precede the D and C. However, D and C, having all the attributes of the N, can create a new version of N. N and D cannot create a new N because it does not have the attributes of C (form), nor can N and C create a new N as it does not have the attributes of D (definition). N and D cannot create a C, nor can N and C create a D, because only N-states can be created as N-states have no form or dimension. An N-state is simply an idea or concept.</span></p><p><img src="../Images/065.n-sources.png" style="float:right;width:1.54167in;height:1.65833in" /><span>This is a very important detail because it means that even though archetypes can appear across the NC and ND spectrums, they cannot create children, so no N-state will ever appear across these spectrums. However, the CD spectrum, which is the axis of </span><em><span>cooperation</span></em><span> or </span><em><span>conflict</span></em><span>, the opposing side to the point of </span><em><span>negotiation</span></em><span>, can create N-states</span><em><span>.</span></em><span> It may appear as though that would limit all the new N-states to only exist on one side of the trigrams, considering only one side of the trigram has the ability to create new N-sources. This is not the case, because as the trigram self-replicates it naturally rotates 60 degrees with each iteration, allowing every side of the trigram to be able to generate new N-sources. The graph on the right shows the lines connecting the N-states and their respective black dots.</span></p><h3><a name="everything-begins-with-trigram" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Everything Begins with Trigram</span></h3><p><span>Just as every element in the periodic table is formed from hydrogen, so too is every generation of the thologram formed from the trigram.</span></p><p><span>A curious observations is if you take the simplest material version of the trigram (hydrogen) and the simplest material version of the hexagon (carbon), the two most fundamental forms in the thologram, and combine them you happen to get hydrocarbons, the most fundamental building blocks of life (and a bunch of plastic stuff). Is it more reasonable to see this as a recurring pattern or to call it a coincidence?</span></p><p><span>We can also apply the same associative reasoning to the thologram as a whole to show how its structure appears as a pattern of growth in nature.</span></p><center><img src="../Images/066-serp-growth.png" style="width:90%"></center><p><span>Here we are using the Sierpinski triangle which does not show the ‘negative space&#39; of the thologram but simply a blank space. In the thologram, this blank space is just as full of implicit patterns as the positive space is of with explicit patterns. More on this shortly.</span></p><p><span>There is no question that the natural processes of creation for nature follow these patterns, and with a little shift in perspective, for the natural process of creation for ideas as well when we apply this pattern to relationships rather than objects.</span></p><p><span>So far all we have described is a 2D trigram. Where is the 3D tetrahedron? Remember, the 2D trigrams </span><em><span>are</span></em><span> the 3D tetrahedron, only flat. What happens when we convert this 2D model to 3D?</span></p><h3><a name="2d-to-3d" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>2D to 3D</span></h3><p><img src="../Images/067-2d-3d.png" style="float:right;width:2.82986in;height:1.35833in" /><span>If we take the parent trigrams and fold it according to its four children, we get a tetrahedron. This is a complete tholon or </span><em><span>tholonic structure</span></em><span>. Tholonic structures naturally occur because they are more efficient as a 3D object than a 2D map, and they are the most stable and complete state of all the properties involved.</span></p><p><span>This tetrahedral structure is fundamental to the fabric of our reality and as such we predict that it should act as an efficient receiver or transmitter or energy, among other things. Indeed, such devices have been built that are commonly used in multiband interactions. This class of antennas is called </span><em><span>harmonic Sierpinski gasket antennas</span></em><span>, or </span><em><span>entropy and fractal antennas</span></em><span>. In addition, some rather ‘fringe&#39; research is being done that purports to be able to take advantage of the harmonic quality of these tetrahedral structures to draw (not generate… more like induction) energy from existing fields. I am deliberately not adding any references to this research because, to date, there has been no research that bears up to scrutiny enough to share, however, simply that it is being researched is very exciting.</span></p><p><span>The implication of this transformation from 2D to 3D is significant, for if we take our 2D model and turn it into a bunch of connected tetrahedrons of tholonic structures, we get the first instance of a 3D model that, among other things, shows the first instance of oscillation.</span></p><p><span>Below is a more complete, step-by-step description of this transition from beginning to end.</span></p><center><img src="../Images/068-dot2tholon.png" style="width:90%"></center><p><span>Tholons model the movement of energy, and consider the existence of form as the consequence of that movement. With that in mind, let&#39;s look at the tholonic explanation using the figures above.</span></p><p><em><span>Fig. a.</span></em><span> We start with a simple trigram. This defines the most fundamental structure of how instantiations of archetypes come to exist, and therefore the flow of energy and their resulting forms as well.</span></p><p><em><span>Fig a1</span></em><span>. The movement of energy inside this trigram will cause a new trigram to form. This most likely place for this new form is opposite the source of the energy and in the balanced center between the two limiting poles created by the source. When it creates its two children they are naturally in reverse order. We now have four trigrams with their points in their natural order and position.</span></p><p><span>As was shown above, the arrangement of the colored point (the NDC points) in each outer trigram are the exact mirror image of the center trigram. One way to think about it is the original trigram reflects itself and by doing so creates a new trigram, which also reflects itself in the two new trigrams (left and right). In this way, the center trigram acts like a reflection trigram, and the two new trigrams are a reflection of a reflection. This will be an important point a little later.</span></p><p><span>Note: We are going to use colors (RGB) rather than types (NDC) because it is easier to explain using colors. You can remember that N = Blue, D = Green, and C = Red, but for the purpose of his descriptions it does not really matter. When it does matter, we will return to NDC labels.</span></p><p><em><span>Fig. a2.</span></em><span> Because energy always follows the path of least resistance and always seeks order, this complete tholon will automatically become a self-sustaining structure (tetrahedron) when all the conditions are met as it would represent the most efficient form. These conditions appear to require 4 types of points; BBB, RGB, RGR, and GRG. Apparently, B points only integrate with themselves and with an R and G together, while the R and G can integrate with each other.</span></p><p><span>This is the same phenomena that happens when a hydrogen atom and an oxygen atom meet; they naturally form a stable state (which also happens to be a trigram in the case of hydrogen and oxygen) that requires less energy than both of them require to maintain a separate existence. This is another example of the reactions causes by the need to create balance, similar to the hydrochloric acid/sodium hydroxide example mentions previously.</span></p><p><span>The implication here is that tholonic interactions can also release energy and that tholonic structures </span><em><span>could</span></em><span> be broken or altered by an outside force that has enough energy.</span></p><p><em><span>Fig. a3.</span></em><span> Each of these child trigrams goes through the exact same process as the parent, with slightly different parameters that are determined by the limitation of their parent. We can now see four trigrams of four trigrams in their 2D form.</span></p><p><em><span>Fig. a4.</span></em><span> This is a 4</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span> generation tholon map, and to get an idea how many sets of tetrahedrons it holds the trigrams have been color-coded to make it easy to see. The darker colors represent what will be the base of a tetrahedron, with the light shade of the same colors representing their sides.</span></p><p><span>You&#39;ll notice that there are six sets of trigrams that are yellow (or a lighter shade of gray). These are identified a little differently because when they form a tetrahedron they do so by going in the opposite direction because they are a mirror image. These are an example of the mirror or reflection trigrams previously mentioned.</span></p><p><em><span>Fig. a5.</span></em><span> If we go ahead and form the tetrahedrons now we end up with a series of tetrahedrons connected at the corners, some pointing forward and some pointing away (the more faded ones). You notice that every odd numbers row (1,3,5,7) are all </span><em><span>forward</span></em><span> trigrams, which we&#39;ll refer to as </span><em><span>real</span></em><span>, a term taken from the world of holography to indicate that the image is projecting in front of the film. Likewise, all even-numbered rows (2,4,6) all pointing in the opposite direction. We&#39;ll call these </span><em><span>virtual</span></em><span> tholons, a term also taken from the world of holography. For every pair of rows (1+2, 3+4, 5+6) there are an equal number of real and virtual tholons.</span></p><p><em><span>Fig. b1.</span></em><span> This is a side view of </span><em><span>Fig. a5</span></em><span>, with the yellow (bottom) tholons being virtual, and the blue (top) tholons being real. The black dots represent the peaks are also shown in </span><em><span>Fig. c1</span></em><span>, for clarity. This is where we see the first instance of oscillation, with the tholons alternating in their movement away from and towards their originating plane, or between the virtual (nothingness?) and real (somethingness?) states.</span></p><p><em><span>Fig b2.</span></em><span> But what is happening in </span><em><span>Fig. b2</span></em><span>? Why are there more tholons stacked on top and on the bottom?</span></p><p><span>If you managed to slug through this up to this point, congratulations! Here is where it gets interesting… Each of these new trigrams formed by the peaks of the previous children acts as the base for </span><em><span>larger</span></em><span> tholons! The process beginning with </span><em><span>Fig. a1</span></em><span> starts all over for not only each one of these trigrams but for every face of a tholon or trigram, including its children.</span></p><p><span>If you look at </span><em><span>Fig. c1</span></em><span>, which is the colorized front view of </span><em><span>Fig. a5</span></em><span>, you&#39;ll notice that there are alternating sets of real and virtual tholons, and the peaks of these tholons (the black dots) naturally create new trigrams.</span></p><p><img src="../Images/069-tripeaks.png" style="float:left;width:2.12986in;height:2.17986in" /><span>In 2</span><sup><span>nd</span></sup><span> generation tholons, the peaks are always the 4</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span> dot type of RGB combined</span><img src="../Images/070-rgbdot2.png" style="width:0.29514in;height:0.29514in" /><span> (which we&#39;ll call </span><em><span>white</span></em><span> dots from here on), so how can a new tholon appear from three white dots? Doesn&#39;t it need three different unique colors to satisfy the conditions for a 4</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span> white dot to exist? In fact, that condition </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> satisfied. If we make the RGB/white dots huge for demonstration purposes you can see how the colors line up to create three separate dots of three separate colors, but these 2</span><sup><span>nd</span></sup><span> generation dots are composed of three pieces of three dots that are 1/3</span><sup><span>rd</span></sup><span> each color.</span></p><p><span>For clarity&#39;s sake, we are referring to each generation of tholon children as </span><em><span>generations,</span></em><span> while the tholons that are created from the peaks of these original tholons, and their children, we refer to as </span><em><span>iterations</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>But wait, didn&#39;t the previous iteration have a base of three separate points of R, G, and B? And now it has a base of three white dots? Yes, but the only way to create three peaks of R, G, and B is to first create the opposite condition of three peaks of white dots. With each iteration this pattern reverses itself, so the 3</span><sup><span>rd</span></sup><span> iteration will be like the 1</span><sup><span>st</span></sup><span>, with bases of RGB (but each one rotated 60 degrees), etc. All the odd number iterations have RGB peaks, and all the even number iterations have white dot peaks. Each iteration builds on the one before it, making larger and larger tholons, as you can see in </span><em><span>Figs. b2, b3, b4</span></em><span>, which shows the progression of real and virtual tholons.  </span></p><p><span>As a relevant aside, this reversing effect, called the </span><em><span>Janibekov effect,</span></em><span>(among other names) is well established in the field of mechanics and is most easily observed in space where there is no gravity.  On observing it for the first time one would think the impossible is happening, but in fact, it is a basic law of energy that we rarely get to see here on Earth because of gravity.  Imagine an asymmetrical rigid body, like a wing-nut or a or handle, rotating around one of its axis, then suddenly, it flips 180 degrees, and continues to rotate around the same axis, but in a reverse position.  After a few moments, it flips again, and continues flipping back and forth indefinitely.  It does this because the lowest energy state, which is the state that all matter seeks,  requires the maximum amount of inertia, and the maximum amount of inertia will always be where the most mass is.  Given that the object is asymmetrical, the amount of mass for each axis will change, causing the object to change position. A quick search for “Janibekov effect” will yield many fascinating videos on this phenomena, but here are some images that will hopefully illustrate the point.  This phenomena is worth mentioning because it is a perfect example of how energy operates in form, and, presumably, in the archetypes of form as well, which, at least tholonically, are asymmetrical tholons.</span></p><p><span>Interestingly, the growth pattern of tholons is the inverse of a recursive Fibonacci sequence. Inverse, because we are multiplying instead of dividing, recursive because we do that for each trigram, children of trigrams, children of children of trigrams, etc.</span></p><p><em><span>Fig. c2.</span></em><span> For this figure, because it would be too complicated to show and describe an entire 5</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span> generation view, we are looking at only a small section of a 5</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span> generation view by showing only four 4</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span> generation tholons (like </span><em><span>Fig. b4</span></em><span>).</span></p><p><em><span>Fig. d1, d2, d3</span></em><span>, and </span><em><span>d4</span></em><span> are isometric views of the figures immediately above them.</span></p><p><span>Fig. d1 shows the first instance of tetrahedrons. This first level is that foundation of all material existence, and as you can see, it looks and acts quite different from iterations that follow (</span><em><span>Fig. d2, d3, d4)</span></em><span>. We believe this first iteration is the domain of element and the quantum world.</span></p><p><span>There are two details worth mentioning. The first is, you&#39;ll notice that in the front view of </span><em><span>Fig. c2</span></em><span> you see the center tholon is a virtual tholon, and behind it, you will see real tholons. This is because just as real tholons can create virtual tholons, virtual tholons can create real tholons. This is where it really starts to sound like a fun-house of mirrors because how can you have real tholons inside virtual tholons? The simple answer is, real tholons in a virtual tholon are real relative to that virtual tholon they are within. These </span><em><span>virtual</span></em><span> real tholons are just as significant as the </span><em><span>real</span></em><span> real tholons because they function in the same manner as a real tholon, but virtually, which allows virtual tholons to be able to ‘reflect&#39; back a real tholon. But, because they are all sourced originally from a virtual holon, they only have virtual significance.</span></p><p><span>The second detail is, to make things more complicated, in the above figures we have colored all the real tholons yellow (light gray) and the virtual tholons blue (darker gray), but in fact, there are yellows among the blue and blues among the yellows. These were left out for simplicity sake as they were not critically important to demonstrate our point. The basic principle is the same however, in that there is an oscillating between real and virtual at each iteration.</span></p><p><span>Now we can start to fold this into itself. Each of four the sides that make up a tholon has their own domains of children as well, so this folding process happens at every generation.</span></p><p><em><span>Fig. d4</span></em><span> shows the small portion of a thologram we have built that we will now begin to fold.</span></p><p><em><span>Fig e1</span></em><span> shows the beginning of the folding.</span></p><p><em><span>Fig. e2</span></em><span> shows the completed folding, with all the real tholons now within the parent, and all the virtual tholons outside of the parent. It&#39;s interesting how that it naturally happens that only the virtual tholons extend past the boundaries of the hologram.</span></p><p><span>It looks like we have broken the rules that no children can exist outside of their parent&#39;s limits because we have a lot of virtual tholons sticking way outside those limits.</span></p><p><span>Remember when we were looking at the Sierpinski Fractal? One of the points made was that Sierpinski treated the empty space between the tetrahedrons as empty, wherein the tholon model it is not empty, but rather negative space that is a reflection of the immediate parent, a necessary nothingness to the tetrahedrons somethingness. Now review the observation that this middle trigram, as mentioned above, is a reflection trigram. In one sense it does not exist any more than your reflection in the mirror does not represent the existence of another you, but it does exist in that the reflection is a perfect mirror-image representation of you, and this has significant value. It is an illusion, but an illusion that we need to take seriously.</span></p><p><span>All the virtual tholons are tholons that were created out of this nothingness space! They are </span><em><span>reflective</span></em><span> tholons only. They do not exist, but they are very important. The virtual tholons are the nothingness complement to the real tholons within the parent through which </span><em><span>their</span></em><span> reflection creates two more real tholons. This does not break the rules that nothing created within the parent can extend past its boundaries any more than looking at yourself in a mirror hanging on the wall does not put you on the other side of the wall, even though it appears that way.</span></p><p><span>Look at </span><em><span>Fig. a5</span></em><span> again. You&#39;ll notice that for every real tholon there is a virtual (reflection) tholon immediately below it. It is because of these virtual reflections that we can generate another iteration of real tholons.</span></p><p><em><span>Fig. e3</span></em><span> shows the ghosts of the virtual tholons, and </span><em><span>Fig. e4</span></em><span> shows only the real tholons folded into their parent tholon.</span></p><p><span>To get a better perspective of the dynamism of this structure, look at </span><em><span>Fig. f1</span></em><span> below, which shows the lines of influence of each tholon (which is that of a sphere).</span></p><p><span>If we go inside this very simple version of a thologram we see what looks like complete chaos (</span><em><span>Fig. f2</span></em><span>), but is, in fact, absolute stunningly perfect order and structure.</span></p><p><img src="../Images/071-thologram-spheres.png" style="width:5.77639in;height:2.325in" /></p><p><span>If we had used the simplest thologram possible in our example, using only 1</span><sup><span>st</span></sup><span> generation folds, rather than the 3</span><sup><span>rd</span></sup><span> generation folds above, it would look like the following:</span></p><p><img src="../Images/072-thologram-inside.png" style="width:4.625in;height:2.46111in" /></p><p><span>There one last point to consider that is best explained in the following thought exercise: Imagine what you would see if you were a 2D person living in a 2D world and an object passed through your 2D reality. You would see a bunch of 2D slices of that object that changed over time.</span></p><p><img src="../Images/073-flatland.png" style="width:5.75in;height:1.70417in" />
<span>Now imagine you are a 3D person living in a 3D world (which should be pretty easy to do) and a 4D object passes through? You will see 3D ‘slices&#39; of this 3D object over time as it passes through. For example, if a 4D ball passed through a 3D world it would first appear as a very tiny 3D ball, and then grow to a large ball, then shrink to a small ball before disappearing.</span></p><p><span>In both 2D and 3D cases, you are not getting the whole picture, but in both cases what you are getting is completely true and valid for the context of your reality.</span></p><p><span>If we were to remove the original collapsed tholons (which represents the elemental and quantum layer of reality) from the model and only look at the iterations that represent the Newtonian material reality we live in, the thologram would look like a perfect tetrahedron, with none of those smaller protrusions that come from the original collapsed tholons.</span></p><p><span>In the same way as the 4D ball, a 4D thologram, being itself a tetrahedron, would first appear as a small tetrahedron, which is what we, and others, are claiming all realty is built from, conceptually at least.</span></p><p><span>Why is this detail important?</span></p><p><span>The 3D model of the thologram is a 3D slice of a 4 (or more) dimensional model. What would an 8D or 248D ‘object&#39; appear as in this 3D world? It could appear as many, many different things. Take a look at all the ways a simple 3D tetrahedral pyramid can appear in 2D orthographic projections.</span></p><p><img src="../Images/074-tetraisos.png" style="width:90%" /></p><p><span>Now imagine the same pyramid with trillions of iterations and many more dimensions! It would have the ability to define or describe every archetype of everything, every idea, every form, that ever has, does or will exist. Its perspectives would effectively be infinite to us, but at its source, it is one thing.</span></p><p><span>To specify the location of a tholon we have to identify each tholon by an address based on its generation.</span></p><p><img src="../Images/075-dimpointer.png" style="width:1.49167in;height:0.98889in" /><img src="../Images/076-dimpath.png" style="width:5.47708in;height:1.59167in" /></p><p><span>If we wanted to reference the topmost tholon in gen 4 by its base trigram, on the bottom right tholon in gen 3, on the bottom left tholon in gen 2, we would need to say it is at 1,3,2,1. The areas blacked out are virtual tholons which don&#39;t really exist (energetically) so we can&#39;t navigate to them (even though we can reference them). So, in this example, we need 4 dimensions to define the location of a tholon. At any one tholon&#39;s location, there can be multiple instances of tholons consisting of all that tholon&#39;s ancestors an descendants. Just saying the location of one tholon could just as easily refer to a subsection of a parent tholons or a group of children tholons. Any dimension would have to record the path taken to arrive at any particular tholon. The reason this is being mentioned is to show that each generation of tholons increases the dimensionality of the thologram by one dimension.</span></p><p><span>For example, to identify the position (P) of one tholon at the 45</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span> iteration we would need a dimension that looked something like:</span></p><p><strong><em><span>P</span></em><span> =</span></strong><span>1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1</span></p><p><span>But it&#39;s even a bit more involved because this dimension only points to one particular tholon within which is its own 3D space. In the thologram, we can&#39;t use a Cartesian coordinate system (i.e. X,Y,Z) because that would require a coordinate system that extends past the boundaries of existence, and we know that there can be no metrics in nothingness. We can only use a </span><em><span>quadray</span></em><span> coordinates (i.e. A,B,C,D) which are based on a tetrahedron, to identify a point within the tholon.</span></p><p><span>Does this mean that our 3D reality is embedded within a parent 3D reality? According to the thologram, yes, although I have no idea how this can be tested. An analogy we have to the idea of a 3D reality within a 3D reality is VR (virtual reality), where we can create countless 3D worlds within our own 3D reality using our existing 3D VR tools. One can easily imagine how we could create virtual realities within those virtual realities. Another analogy is how a hologram we can create a 3D space from a 2D surface, and there can be many 3D spaces on top of one another recorded in that same 2D surface.</span></p><h3><a name="synergetics" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Synergetics</span></h3><p><span>What some people today call </span><em><span>sacred geometry</span></em><span> our ancestors simply called geometry. Contrary to what we learned in school, geometry is as much a study of philosophy as it is a study of form, space, and mathematics. Plato, Pythagoras, Parmenides, and a number of other great philosophers were well-schooled in geometry, but the marriage of philosophy and geometry goes back even further in history, and across every culture. Take the quadray coordinates system as an example. One could make a case that the Ancient Babylonian base-60 number system was an early version of this idea.</span></p><p><em><span>Synergetics</span></em><span> is a modern-day example of how geometry forms the basis of the structure of creation, life and how everything interacts with each other. Buckminster Fuller coined the term </span><em><span>synergetics</span></em><span> in his three-volume work “</span><em><span>Synergetics. Explorations in the Geometry of Thinking</span></em><span>.”</span><sup><a href='#52'><span>52</span></a></sup><span>, wherein he explains how using a 60-degree coordinates system can explain both physics and chemistry, but more importantly, he believed that it also explained reality. In his words:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>Since physical Universe is entirely energetic, all dimension must be energetic. Synergetics is energetic geometry since it identifies energy with number. Energetic geometry employs 60-degree coordination because that is nature&#39;s way to closest-pack spheres.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>He explains how the points and the lines of a tetrahedron (60-degree coordinates) describe all elementary phenomena. Moreover, he claims that synergetics can measure our experiences geometrically, and how we can employ geometry regarding both metaphysical and physical knowledge.</span></p><p><span>The math he proposes is, according to him, based on the reality of empiricism, seeing as that all atoms are made of tetrahedrons, octahedrons, rhombic dodecahedrons, and cubes. Using this synergetic math, we have a coordinate system that works omnirationally, energetically, arithmetically, geometrically, chemically, volumetrically, crystallographically, vectorially, topologically, and energy-quantum-wise.</span><sup><a href='#53'><span>53</span></a></sup></p><p><span>Within the thologram there are higher-order forms as well that are created by tetrahedrons, such as cubes</span><img src="../Images/077-tform1.png" style="width:0.325in;height:0.37153in" alt="Cubic-body-centered.svg" /><span>, hexagons</span><img src="../Images/078-tform2.png" style="width:0.39583in;height:0.40833in" alt="Hexagonal.svg" /><span>, tetragons</span><img src="../Images/079-tform3.png" style="width:0.325in;height:0.49028in" alt="Tetragonal.svg" /><span>, rhombohedra&#39;s</span><img src="../Images/080-tform4.png" style="width:0.34167in;height:0.34722in" alt="Rhombohedral.svg" /><span>, orthorhombics</span><img src="../Images/081-tform5.png" style="width:0.325in;height:0.42292in" alt="Orthorhombic.svg" /><span>, or truncated icosahedrons, </span><img src="../Images/082-soccorball.png" style="width:0.52014in;height:0.525in" /><span>which is commonly known as the </span><em><span>Bucky Ball</span></em><span>, or, when in atomic form, </span><em><span>Buckminsterfullerene</span></em><span> (basically, it&#39;s a soccer ball).</span></p><p><span>The thologram, which is based entirely on the tetrahedron and quadray coordinates, is a model of knowledge, thought, and ideas. It&#39;s important to remember that the map is not the territory. These models of reality are like maps that describe the terrain. There are elevation maps, density maps, road maps, water maps, contour maps, temperature maps, population maps, economy maps, crime maps, San Francisco even has human feces maps! They all describe the same territory from different perspectives. The thologram is just one template that is a description, so to speak, a language that defines the organization and pattern of all energy at every level.</span></p><p><img src="../Images/083-3cubeprob.png" style="float:right;width:2.27847in;height:1.175in" /><span>There are many alternative ways to map the thologram.

And guess what? We do! But with a twist.</span></p><p><span>The actual first instance of matter are the elements, but no element has a tetrahedral structure when it is isolated. It is the bonds between elements that create the tetrahedral structure. In the tholonic model, the individual elements exist at the first level of the thologram, which are the first tholons created by the folding of the 2D ‘map&#39; and are shown as the numerous and small tetrahedrons upon which ever-larger tetrahedral structures emerge from.</span></p><p><span>As a result, we would not see any 3D structures until the first iteration that emerges. A single H</span><sub><span>2</span></sub><span>O molecule is not a tetrahedron, it is a trigram. Water, however, is tetrahedral. This also supports the claim that elements exist within the first pre-iteration instance of tholons, the very first, and smallest, tetrahedrons, but it also shows that some simple compounds are in this pre-iterations space as well.</span></p><p><img src="../Images/084-azotosome.png" style="float:right;width:2in;height:2.17014in" /><span>Water is a particularly good substance for exploring tholonic structures because it is one of the first, if not </span><em><span>the</span></em><span> first, tetrahedral structure that all life depends on. Another early structure that is tetrahedral as a molecule alone is methane, one the first organic molecules and not just a building block of life on earth, but quite possibly the basis for an entirely different form of life, as pictured in the </span><em><span>Azotosome</span></em><span> on the right, and one we might discover on the Saturn moon of Titan.</span></p><p><span>In the above geometry, we see that in the first generation of a tholon we have 4 trigrams, 3 of which are descending (downward-pointing trigram) and one is ascending (upward-pointing trigram).

One atom is oxygen, which has an atomic number of 8 as it has 8 protons in its nucleus, which defines how much energy it holds as a ‘charge&#39;. It also supports 8 electrons in its outermost shell, which represents its most balanced state. The other two atoms are hydrogen, the very first instance of Newtonian matter, the kind of matter that makes up physical reality as we know it. It has an atomic number of 1 and has only one proton, one electron, and one neutron. Although oxygen wants 8 electrons in its outer shell, it only has 6, so it naturally forms a bond with two hydrogen atoms by sharing the one electron each hydrogen has to offer.</span></p><p><span>From a tholonic perspective, oxygen follows the pattern of two 3</span><sup><span>rd</span></sup><span> gen tholons from one face of a 2</span><sup><span>nd</span></sup><span> gen tholon, which has 6 </span><em><span>real</span></em><span> tholons and 2 </span><em><span>virtual</span></em><span> tholons (</span><em><span>Fig. v1, showing two 3</span><sup><span>rd</span></sup><span> gen tholons</span></em><span>).

This was later discovered and called the </span><em><span>quark</span></em><span>.)</span></p><p><span>Consider that protons have a charge of +1 and are composed of two </span><em><span>up</span></em><span> quarks, which have a charge of +2/3, and </span><em><span>one</span></em><span> down quark, which has a charge of -1/3, and neutrons have a charge of 0 and are composed of one up quark and two down quarks.</span></p><p><span>This is seen in a single tholon and its reflection tholon as shown in </span><em><span>Fig. q1</span></em><span> and </span><em><span>q1a</span></em><span> below. The upper trigram has a parent trigram at the top which we can assign a value of -1/3, and the two children can be assigned a value of +2/3. The center trigram, which is always a reflection trigram, has a value of 0. The opposite is true for the lower reflection trigram as well. With these values, the upper tholon has a charge of 1 and its reflection tholon has a charge of 0. This also seems to indicate that a truly complete tholon requires two tholons; itself and its reflection tholon.</span></p><p><span>If we looked at the 2D thologram map which shows these complete tholons of a pair of virtual and real tholons together, we get what is shown in </span><em><span>Fig. q2</span></em><span>. You&#39;ll notice this is identical to the previous graph (</span><em><span>Fig. h1</span></em><span>) that shows the lines of succession from N-sources to N-states across all three directions. This would suggest that quarks are an instance of N-states. Given that these pairs and also arranged in three different angles, 60 degrees apart, it would also suggest (remember, I am not a quantum physicist) that there are three classes of quarks.</span></p><p><span>Neutrons </span><em><span>do</span></em><span> exist, which seems to go against the tholonic idea that the virtual tholons don&#39;t create anything, but remember, this thologram is a model of energy and relationships, not of form, so what we would expect to see is some</span><em><span>thing</span></em><span> that has zero energy... like a neutron. And what holds all these subatomic particles together? The </span><em><span>strong nuclear force</span></em><span> (mainly), which is the tholonic equivalent of six integrated N-sources, the blue dot at the center of every hexagram composed of six N-sources, that holds the tholons together.</span></p><p><span>This is a significant observation. Most of what we have shown here involves how the movement of energy, in accordance to laws, brings form and ideas into existence, yet almost nothing is said about the nature of the energy itself, other than that energy in its purest form is ultimately an expression of awareness and intention. Here we have six N-sources which hold the tholons together to form the centers of all creation. In the quantum world, there is a similar concept of this energy that holds everything together, called </span><em><span>gluons</span></em><span>. Gluons hold quarks together using the </span><em><span>strong nuclear force</span></em><span>. Tholonically speaking it is the laws, described as geometry in the thologram, that hold everything together. The claim then is that gluons are an instance of that law. The other forces that holds things together are electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, and gravity, all (hypothetically) different instances of the same laws expressed geometrically in the thologram.</span></p><p><span>Understanding the nature of these forces may well give us an insight into understanding the nature of the source of the energy, which is to say, understanding the nature of awareness and intention.</span></p><center><img src="../Images/087-tholo-quark.png" style="width:90%"></center><p><span>There is also an interesting relationship with the One Electron Theory. This is a theory that theoretical physicist John Wheeler proposed (in a phone call at 2AM in 1940 with Richard Feynman) that there was just one electron in existence, and that all electrons were the same electron! This would be possible if that one electron was not subject to space-time, allowing it to be in all places simultaneously. Wheeler also claimed that not only are all electrons the same electron, but all positrons are also the same electron moving backward in time. As an electron it had a charge of -1, and as a positron it had a charge of +1.</span></p><p><span>The problem was, there was no space for a positron in the current model of the electron</span></p><p><span>In order to account for all the electrons in the universe, this one electron would have to move backward in time at least one time less than the number of electrons moving forward. This prerequisite is satisfied as can be seen in the previous diagrams of “progression of trigram to tholon” where there is always one more iteration of real tholons then there is virtual tholons.</span></p><p><span>If Wheelers idea was correct, then that there should be almost as many positrons in the universe as electrons, but there aren&#39;t.</span></p><p><span>Wheeler suggested that the missing positrons might be hidden within protons. This idea does not work with the current theory that a proton consists of only two up quarks, each with a charge of +2/3, and one down quark with a charge of –1/3 as there is simply no place in the proton where a positron, with a charge of +1, could hide.</span></p><p><span>However, in the tholonic model, there </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> a place for the positron hide, and that is in the virtual space of a tholon. As was previously mentions, there can be real tholons within virtual tholons. As this virtual space also acts as a reflection for the other three trigrams of a tholon, probably reversing the spin of that positron, it would act as the source positive charge of the </span><em><span>child</span></em><span> tholon.</span></p><p><span>But what about the electron? Where is that? Tholonically speaking, the electron is a product of the imbalance of this hexagram, as it has a total charge of +1, and therefore it will automatically create an equal and opposite negative charge of -1. Where would this electron exist? At the opposite side of the N-sources across the scope of its children C and D, which is where N-sources manifest as stable expressions, i.e. on the outer most edge of the hexagram. In a complete and folded tholon, these three scopes create the three edges of the outer tholon that is opposite the reflection tholon, represented by the three black dots in </span><em><span>Fig. q1a</span></em><span>. As there are three different directions of these patterns, each 60 degrees apart, there is access to any active interface (which instantiates as an electron) for every angle of the thologram.</span></p><h3><a name="while-were-here" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>While we&#39;re here</span></h3><p><img src="../Images/088-tholo-trimath.png" style="float:right;width:2.6in;height:2.19097in" /><span>This would be a good place to briefly point out other patterns in other systems. For example, Newton&#39;s 2nd Law nicely fits into a tholon. Let&#39;s use Ohms Law to test it out.</span></p><p><span>If we replace…</span></p><ul><li><span>N (negotiation) with V (voltage)</span></li><li><span>D (definition) with R (resistance)</span></li><li><span>C (contribution) with I (current)</span></li></ul><p><span>… we can then state the following:</span></p><p><img src="../Images/089-tformulas.png" style="width:5.75in;height:0.80278in" /></p><h3><a name="the-meaning-of-math" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>The Meaning of Math</span></h3><p><span>Before we move on, let&#39;s follow up on this concept of how the trigram can describe the math functions of Ohm&#39;s law.</span></p><p><span>What do the math symbols mean in the real world? Addition and subtraction are easy concepts to grasp in the real world. We take so man of one thing and add or remove so many of another thing. A good example of the effects of addition and subtraction is how they affect colors.</span></p><p><img src="../Images/090-addition.png" style="width:3.73in;height:1.87in" /></p><p><span>What are multiplication and division then? It is the definition of one property by the units of another. For example, in division, such as </span><em><span>12/4=3, we are stating that</span></em><span> there are 3 units of 4 in a 12. In multiplication, such as </span><em><span>3</span><span>*</span><span>4=12,</span></em><span> we are determining how many units of 4 we are adding together to create 12. The 4, as the divisor or multiplier, becomes the defacto unit of measurement.</span></p><p><span>As mentioned above, we would expect to see the same laws expressed in different ways across all the scopes that the laws apply to, so we would expect to see an example of Newton&#39;s 2</span><sup><span>nd</span></sup><span> law in the tholonic realms of society, or planets, or organisms… and we do.</span></p><p><span>We&#39;ve seen this applied to electricity but it can apply to more abstract concepts as well. For example, if we claim that a society is a product of its laws (cultural or otherwise), and we also posit that laws are to be measured by ethics, we can say </span><em><span>society = laws / ethics</span></em><span>, which says that the value of </span><em><span>ethics</span></em><span> is by what </span><em><span>laws</span></em><span> should be measured by when evaluating </span><em><span>society</span></em><span>. By the same token, </span><em><span>ethics = laws/society</span></em><span>, which claims that </span><em><span>ethics</span></em><span> can be determined when measuring </span><em><span>laws</span></em><span> by their value to </span><em><span>society</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>You can see that these two examples follow Newton&#39;s 2</span><sup><span>nd</span></sup><span> law, so what would happen if we applied the other formulas of Newton&#39;s 2</span><sup><span>nd</span></sup><span> law using these same values? For example, we can determine </span><em><span>power</span></em><span> in the context of </span><em><span>society</span></em><span> (and the initial claims regarding laws and society), which is </span><em><span>power=laws</span><span>*</span><span>society, which states that power is the degree to which society that is enabled by laws?</span></em><span> It is up to the reader to decide if </span><em><span>laws</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>society</span></em><span>, and </span><em><span>ethics</span></em><span>, or concepts like </span><em><span>enabled</span></em><span>, are the best concepts to use here and if so, what the </span><em><span>power</span></em><span> (the rate, over time, at which energy is transferred) represents, and what energy itself represents in this context.</span></p><p><span>This can apply to any properly defined trigram, like the cognitive behavioral trigram shown above. For example, if we claim that a </span><em><span>behavior</span></em><span> is a product of </span><em><span>thoughts</span></em><span> (one’s own or those one is exposed to) and we also posit that </span><em><span>thoughts</span></em><span> are to be measured by </span><em><span>feelings</span></em><span>, we can say </span><em><span>behavior = thoughts / feelings</span></em><span>, which says that the value of </span><em><span>feelings</span></em><span> is the measure by which we should value </span><em><span>thoughts</span></em><span> when evaluating </span><em><span>behavior</span></em><span>. By the same token, </span><em><span>feelings = thoughts/behavior</span></em><span>, which claims that </span><em><span>feelings</span></em><span> can be determined when measuring </span><em><span>thoughts</span></em><span> by their value to </span><em><span>behavior.</span></em><span>  Further, we can speculate as to what the 4th ‘white dot’ might be… intention? heart? Let’s call it </span><em><span>X</span></em><span> for now.  We can determine what </span><em><span>X</span></em><span> is, as we did above with </span><em><span>society</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>law</span></em><span> and </span><em><span>ethics</span></em><span>,  by evaluating </span><em><span>thoughts</span></em><span> that are reinforced (‘multiplied’) by </span><em><span>behavior</span></em><span>.  Perhaps </span><em><span>X=beliefs</span></em><span>? </span></p><p><span>In any case, the twelve formulas of Newton&#39;s 2</span><sup><span>nd</span></sup><span> show some very interesting relationships between ethics, laws, society, and ‘power&#39;, and, in my humble opinion, a new perspective on the dynamics of culture and society that, if nothing else, raises some important questions. As it applies here, it shows how the tholon can describe everything from atoms to culture. Because the math involved in a tholon can be more than the reader might be interested in, the subject is covered more deeply in Appendix D.</span></p><p><span>What is being said here is that from the 3+1 dimensions of reality, to the laws of electricity, to the way the psyche works, all of these are expressions of the same primary archetype, and its children.  This means that </span><em><span>thoughts</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>volts</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>laws</span></em><span>, and the </span><em><span>Z</span></em><span> axis  are the same primal energy or awareness expressed in very different contexts and scopes, just as are </span><em><span>feelings</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>ethics</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>resistance</span></em><span>, and the </span><em><span>X</span></em><span> axis, or </span><em><span>society</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>behavior</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>current</span></em><span>, and the </span><em><span>Y</span></em><span> axis.  This then implies that </span><em><span>beliefs</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>time</span></em><span>, (social) </span><em><span>power</span></em><span>, and (electrical) </span><em><span>power</span></em><span> are also the same +1 ‘white dot’ in different contexts and scopes.</span></p><p><span>With this in mind, let&#39;s reexamine the above claims:</span></p><p><strong><span>Definition = Negotiation / Contribution</span></strong></p><p><span>The definition of something is its boundaries, limits, abilities, attributes, properties, and resources. All of these details are the results of the scope and context of that thing&#39;s instance. It could be environmental factors, genetic attributes, planetary limitations, such as size and weight of a thing, energy levels, etc. It is the nature of energy to expand in every way possible. That expansion is the contribution, but it is the resistance from these factors that determines what expansions get the opportunity to be expressed and what expansions are thwarted. That battle between the force of expansion and the force of resistance is the negotiation (</span><em><span>see Negotiation=Contribution</span><span>*</span><span>Definition</span></em><strong><span>)</span></strong><span>. As </span><em><span>Definition</span></em><span> is </span><em><span>Negotiation</span></em><span> / </span><em><span>Contribution</span></em><span>, we can say that </span><em><span>Definition</span></em><span> is measured by that which is </span><em><span>Contributed</span></em><span>, or, the </span><em><span>Definition</span></em><span> of something is determined by what is can (sustainably) </span><em><span>Contribute</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><strong><span>Contribution = Negotiation / Definition</span></strong></p><p><span>What a thing can </span><em><span>Contribute</span></em><span> is measured by its </span><em><span>Definition</span></em><span>, but the degree to which it can contribute is determined by its environment and how it interacts with that environment. That interaction is a result of </span><em><span>Negotiation</span></em><span>. A thing must provide something that something in its environment needs, otherwise what it has to contribute is useless.</span></p><p><strong><span>Negotiation = Contribution x Definition</span></strong></p><p><span>A thing&#39;s ability to find a stable and sustainable position within its environment and scope is determined by the degree to which it can contribute with it current resources. A thing may have a </span><em><span>Definition</span></em><span> that gives it a lot of A and a little of B, but if its environment needs a lot of B and very little A, then it is B that the thing must </span><em><span>Contribute</span></em><span> to ensure its existence in that environment, or it needs to find another environment, or change the environment it is in so that A is in more demand.</span></p><p><span>You get the point. What&#39;s more, we can not only confirm this arrangement using Ohm&#39;s Law, but we can now include all twelve relationships of Ohm&#39;s Law using a tetrahedron, rather than just the three we can see in a trigram, which is a 2D tholonic map of electricity, as there is no 4</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span> composite ‘white dot&#39; (which would represent </span><em><span>power,</span></em><span> or </span><em><span>watts</span></em><span>). Once we have that power value, we can map all the formulas of Ohm&#39;s Law to a complete tholon.</span></p><h4><a name="claim-44-there-is-no-useless-data-only-data-we-have-yet-to-understand-how-to-use" class="md-header-anchor"></a><strong><span>Claim 44:</span></strong><span> There is no useless data, only data we have yet to understand how to use. </span></h4><p><img src="../Images/092-two2Dmaps.png" style="width:5.74792in;height:2.53333in" /></p><p><span>Previously we saw how the contribution of red divides the green on one side (right) but constrains the green on the opposite (left) side.

The minor difference between panpsychism and tholonism is that the latter claims it is awareness and intention, not consciousness, which is the property of existence and from which consciousness and intelligence arise.</span></p><p><span>Intelligence in this context does not mean “critical thinking” or “self-aware”, but it does mean creativity, learning, and problem-solving, properties that nature, and the universe, has demonstrated with flying colors. We can go further and claim that the amazing relationships in simple geometry, such as the tetrahedron array with its Fibonacci numbers and hexagonal patterns that pretty much define reality are evidence of logic. So, let&#39;s add “logic” to the list of properties. What about “planning”? Does nature plan anything or do we all just happen to live in a corner of the Universe that was lucky enough to win the Cosmic Mega-Lotto? We can easily see that the simple relationships between three points instantly define an infinite array for order, pattern, and symmetry on many levels. This isn&#39;t just a ‘plan&#39;, it is </span><em><span>the</span></em><span> plan.</span></p><p><span>Is there creativity in the universe? Only if one considers all of creation an act of creativity. Does the universe learn? Well, have things evolved over the past 4.5 billion years? If you answer yes, then we&#39;ll add </span><em><span>learning</span></em><span> to the list. What about problem-solving? This is a tricky one, because there is no such thing as a ‘problem&#39; from the perspective of existence, because, as we have covered, if something does not follow the laws it does not exist. If it doesn&#39;t follow the laws, it doesn&#39;t exist, so where&#39;s the problem as far the Universe is concerned? “Problems” appear to be exclusive to humans. Still, the fact that existence is only afforded to that which follows the laws, I would say that this is damn good preemptive problem solving as it prevents problems from ever happening in the first place.</span></p><p><span>So far, we have:</span></p><ul><li><span>Creativity</span></li><li><span>Learning</span></li><li><span>Problem-solving</span></li><li><span>Logic</span></li><li><span>Planning</span></li></ul><p><span>Here we have been making the case that ideas themselves are an expression of energy, and as they clearly incorporate and are even defined by all the properties of intelligence listed, it&#39;s reasonable to conclude that ideas themselves emerge from a form of intelligence, and may even have their own intelligence.</span></p><p><span>However, this intelligence is quite different from what we would call human intelligence because of its aggregate nature. It&#39;s more of a recursively embedded network of countless decentralized nodes of intelligence.  A more graspable metaphor to think of intelligence as a large tree, and parts of that tree as instances of that tree; trunk, branch, stem, leaf, seed, etc.  There can be many instances of each type, such as a leaf, but they are all part of the tree, and only part of the tree as they can not exist without the tree.  You and I, and all things. are but ‘leaves’ or ‘seeds’ or ‘stems’, or parts thereof, on this tree of universal intelligence, and like the leaf, we can not exist without it (even though we think we can).</span></p><h3><a name="aggregates" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Aggregates</span></h3><p><span>One of the attributes of a tholon, unlike its holarchic predecessor, is that the context and scope of a tholon is not only defined by the dualities of that tholon, but also by all the tholons above and below, as the children tholons are always contributing to the parent, and the parents are always defining the children.</span></p><h4><a name="claim-45-anything-that-exists-that-has-a-sustainable-pattern-of-energy-has-some-form-of-intelligence-and-is-a-contributing-element-to-the-larger-intelligence-that-is-shared-by-all-existence" class="md-header-anchor"></a><strong><span>Claim 45:</span></strong><span> Anything that exists, that has a sustainable pattern of energy, has some form of intelligence and is a contributing element to the larger intelligence that is shared by all existence. </span></h4><p><span>It is easy to see instances of this on a molecular level, such as how water is an aggregate of hydrogen and oxygen, as the scopes and contexts of the elements are fairly well known.</span></p><p><span>We have a similar concept in the way our social institutions work. </span><em><span>Interinstitutionality</span></em><span>, as this has been termed, explains how the various institutions of society like financial markets, governments, family structures, educational institutions, etc., all intertwine and create amalgamations and aggregates with one another.</span></p><p><span>Interinstitutional research is defined as the investigation of the chain of complex, interrelated problems regarding tactics, sampling, data reliability, and notions of causality within the realm of each separate institution with the goal of improving aggregation and amalgamation.</span><sup><a href='#59'><span>59</span></a></sup></p><p><span>Take the institution of the modern American family as an example. It can take many forms, but several extra-familial institutions affect the complexion of &quot;family&quot;, such as the market, profession, educational institutions, political affiliation, etc. Each of these institutions brings to bear its own forces and logic on the amalgamated and aggregated institution of the &quot;family&quot;.</span></p><p><span>The market shapes perceptions of standards of living in the family. The profession shape ideas of work and service. Educational institutions shape the ideas and direction of society. Politics shapes our understandings of the role and participation of family members.</span></p><p><span>All institutions of society are not simply autonomous social units isolated from wider institutional dynamics, but rather several structures wrapped up and labeled according to the concept of its purpose, each structure having its own set of rules, scopes, and contexts, forming aggregate and amalgamated rules, scopes, and contexts.</span></p><p><span>This is equally true for the institution of modern science which is every bit the product of Interinstitutionality as any other single institution. Far from the secular myth of an objective value-free isolated social unit, modern science is itself an amalgamation of a whole host of non-scientific institutional factors such as the market, education, special interests, the state, politics, professions, etc.</span></p><h3><a name="intelligence" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Intelligence</span></h3><p><span>We have a concept of a </span><em><span>human</span></em><span> collective intelligence, but we define it as something that has emerged from human intelligence, as opposed to human intelligence being an instance of an existing collective intelligence.</span></p><p><span>The tholonic view is that awareness and intention are not only attributes of existence; they are the cause of it, as explained previously. More than that, they are the ultimate, or purest form, of what we call energy, as energy is the balancing of a difference, and all differences come from separation, which is the result of awareness and intention.</span></p><h4><a name="claim-46-every-archetype-has-an-awareness-an-intention-and-an-intelligence-appropriate-for-its-scope" class="md-header-anchor"></a><strong><span>Claim 46:</span></strong><span> Every archetype has an awareness, an intention, and an intelligence appropriate for its scope. </span></h4><p><span>On this point, tholonic thinking has coincidentally arrived at the same conclusion recorded 3,000 years ago in the Sanskrit Vedas which states that first there was awareness, then there was consciousness, and because of this, consciousness or intelligence can never be the path to awareness. On the contrary, the path to awareness starts with quieting consciousness, according to the Vedas. This point starts to lead into a philosophical realm, so we&#39;ll just leave it at that and let the reader take from there.</span></p><p><span>However, the tholonic view is that intelligence precedes consciousness. This is fairly compatible with the traditional definition of intelligence as “The ability to learn or understand or to deal with new or trying situations.”</span></p><p><span>The difference being, in the tholonic model, consciousness is not necessary to learn, understand or deal. We are seeing this today in AI systems that certainly can learn, understand and deal with the challenges before them, but these AI systems are not conscious… yet. Does that mean these AI systems have awareness? Yes, at least to the degree that everything has some level of awareness given that awareness is the source of existence.</span></p><p><span>The tholonic definition of </span><em><span>intelligence</span></em><span> is slightly different:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>The ability to maintain a sustainable pattern of energy within the scope of its existence.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>As patterns come from order, which is the result of energy, and energy is awareness, then by this definition, intelligence is synonymous with “ordered or structured awareness.”</span></p><p><span>According to this definition, each tholon has its own form, or expression, of intelligence, its own patterns of energy (awareness) that are contextually appropriate for its scope. Rocks, then, have intelligence, as do planets, galaxies, chairs, and even what we would consider garbage. Any concept that satisfies the tholonic requirements to exist has an intelligence. Geometrically speaking, each tetrahedron in the thologram represents an awareness and an intelligence for that tholon.</span></p><p><span>Because we consider tholonic instances (</span><em><span>things</span></em><span> like trees, humans, and planets) to be the result of these laws and patterns of energy that exist within the tholonic archetype of that instance, we also consider the intelligence of those instances to be an expression of the tholonic intelligence. In modern terms, this would be something like the collective mind of, say, a species, or a community, or even a relationship.</span></p><p><span>These archetypal intelligences, or collective minds, interact with one another according to the three fundamental relationships as already noted: Negotiation, Definition, and Contribution.</span></p><h3><a name="cooperation" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Cooperation</span></h3><p><span>In short, this describes the Darwinian world of evolution, which is a bottom-up view of these ideas. Take, for example, the amazing relationship between humans and the honeyguide birds. In this symbiotic relationship, the bird tells the humans where the beehives are, the humans go and then collect the honey, leaving the wax and the larva, which is what the birds want.</span></p><p><span>Think of what s involved in these interactions. The birds know collectively that they have humans to help them. With that knowledge, they go out in search of beehives, which they could not even attempt to gain access to without help, which means at some point some bird had the idea to recruit humans.</span></p><p><span>When one of them finds a hive, they announce it to their friends and then go and find humans who they know they can enlist, humans who have learned how to communicate with them. The birds hop and chatter is a specific way that humans know is the message that they have found a hive. The humans collect their tools and tell the birds they are ready. The birds then fly toward the hive, knowing to always keep their white tail feathers visible to the humans. When they all arrive at the hive the humans smoke out the bees, chop down the tree, remove the honey and give the rest to the birds. This is a beautiful example of cooperation between two groups that are competing with another group.</span></p><p><span>What is truly amazing about this arrangement is that the birds and humans have developed their own language</span><sup><a href='#60'><span>60</span></a></sup><span>. Although it is not clear how this arrangement began, it is speculated that it was initiated by the birds when they saw that humans had the ability to make smoke and chop down trees… so a long, long time ago.</span></p><p><span>Are we being asked to believe that a really smart bird came up with the idea, explained it to his bird tribe, then educated and trained not only them but the humans in the manner of communication that this industrial bird invented? Likewise, how long would it take for a human to know that a hopping, chattering bird was trying to till him “Hey, I found a beehive I am totally incapable of getting to, so I will tell you where it is if you and your boys use your smoke and axes to get to it. You then take the honey and give is the wax and larvae. Deal?”</span></p><p><span>This sounds quite similar to the improbabilities described in the tall-tales of ayahuasca and curare.</span></p><p><span>A better explanation is that the intelligences of the archetypes have made this arrangement and once made, is transmitted to their instances, the birds and the humans, who effectively test-drive the idea to the best of the limited abilities of the instances. We see these same type of arrangements ants, spiders, beetles, monkeys, etc.</span></p><h3><a name="competition" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Competition</span></h3><p><span>Not all arrangements are cooperative. Take the example of </span><em><span>cymothoa exigua</span></em><span>, a tiny crustacean that attaches itself to the base of the fish&#39;s tongue and begins sucking the blood out of the fish&#39;s tongue. Eventually, the tongue shrivels up and fall off, at which point the parasite attaches itself to the tongue muscles and actually become the fish&#39;s tongue, presumably getting first dibs of anything the fish plans to eat.</span></p><p><span>Some parasites are as terrifying as they are ingenious in the way that can take over the brain of their host and make them behave in ways that boggle the mind. When the </span><em><span>leucochloridium paradoxum</span></em><span> gets itself inside a snail, not only does it make the snails eyes bulge out to look like a caterpillar, it ‘drives&#39; the snail into open territory so that birds that like to eat caterpillars will eat it, and thereby transfer the parasite into the bird, where it will lay eggs that are embedded in the bird droppings all over the countryside.</span></p><p><span>One of my favorite parasites, in so far as it fills me with dread and makes me shiver, is the </span><em><span>ampulex compressa</span></em><span>, commonly known as the Emerald Jewel Wasp. This female wasp has strategically figured out that the best place to lay her eggs is inside a cockroach, as it can provide shelter (its exoskeleton) and food (its guts). Needless to say, the cockroach is not so keen on this idea, and being much larger than the wasp, not so easy to convince.</span></p><p><span>The wasp approaches the problem from another angle. She sneaks up on the cockroach and using her stinger paralyzes the front section of its body. With the patient unable to move, she carefully makes a second injection of venom that has been created specifically for this purpose, perfectly placed into a specific area of the roach&#39;s brain past the ganglionic sheath, which is the cockroach&#39;s brain protector. This magic potion blocks very specific receptors of neurotransmitters that destroy the roach&#39;s fight or flight responses. She has not turned the cockroach into a zombie, per se, as some have suggested, but rather into something between a zombie and teenage boy going on his first date, for as soon as the paralyzing drug wears off, rather than run, the cockroach grooms himself! It seems as though the drug injected into his brain floods it with dopamine, so the cockroach is insanely happy at this point. He then blissfully follows her back to her place (an underground burrow). There, she lays her egg on top of the swooning cockroach, then bites of its antennae and uses it like a straw to drink the cockroach&#39;s blood. Refreshed, she leaves the burrow and seals it with rocks. A few days later the egg hatches and the larvae slowly consume the insides of the roach until they form a cocoon. The cockroach finally dies, and, the adult wasp emerges from its lovesick corpse.</span></p><p><span>I would very much like to have someone explain to how this process not only evolved but how the wasp knows how to make the super mixture of GABA, β-alanine, and taurine together that that can immobilize and zombify the cockroach in one shot to the ganglion. Not only that, but the wasp larva is covered with a substance (mellein and micromolide) that stops the growth of all those really nasty and very tough-to-kill pathogens that live in the gut of a cockroach. In fact, that stuff on the larvae is being investigated for use in medicine to kill antibiotic-resistant pathogens… that&#39;s how good it is!</span></p><p><span>The tholonic view of this is that the highly sophisticated intelligence of both of these archetypes is responsible for the amazingly sophisticated techniques, chemistry, planning, forethought, etc. This relationship appears to be both competitive as well as cooperative, for it seems that only the slower, less aware, cockroaches tend to be the victims.</span><sup><a href='#61'><span>61</span></a></sup><span> So, in a way, the wasps are doing the work of pruning the cockroach gene pool of the less gifted of the bunch, which ultimately enhances the abilities of the cockroach collective and by extension its tholonic intelligence, of which the gene pool in an instance of.</span></p><h3><a name="findhorn" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Findhorn</span></h3><p><span>This idea of objective intelligences was also known among the founders of the miraculous Scottish community founded in 1962 called Findhorn. The founders claim they managed to turn their arid dessert-like terrain into a lush garden by communicating with the spirits of the plants, and of the earth itself, who guided them on how to properly use the soil despite it being very poor quality. Soon they were producing 40-pound cabbages and stunning horticultural experts who came to see this miracle garden from around the world.</span></p><p><span>They also claim they managed pest control, as they use no chemicals or pesticides, by forming cooperative relationships with the collective intelligences of each species; the deer, the bugs, the rabbits, etc. Reportedly this worked very well with all the species except one. The rat was not interested in any &#39;deal&#39; and stood firm in its “It&#39;s either you or us” position.</span></p><p><span>This last part is anecdotal, but what is not anecdotal is Findhorn&#39;s phenomenal success in horticulture in an area considered impossible for what they have accomplished.</span></p><h3><a name="cosmic-serpent" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Cosmic Serpent</span></h3><p><span>Lastly, A Canadian anthropologist explores this idea thoroughly in his book </span><em><span>The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the origins of knowledge</span></em><span>, which he wrote after living several years in the Amazon studying the shamanic knowledge of botanics. His book explores the relationships and similarities between this indigenous knowledge and our modern understanding of molecular biology, medicine, and DNA. We won&#39;t get into his amazing discoveries here, other than to say that their understanding demonstrates some sort of access to knowledge far beyond what could reasonably be considered to have been passed down by folklore and legend. It is well worth the read.</span></p><h4><a name="claim-47-every-thing-that-exists-is-an-instance-of-an-archetype" class="md-header-anchor"></a><strong><span>Claim 47:</span></strong><span> Every thing that exists is an instance of an archetype.</span></h4><h1><a name="fields" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>FIELDS</span></h1><p><span>Tholons are the result of the movement of energy, which creates fields. The more order and stability a tholon has, the more energy it can move, the stronger its field.</span></p><p><span>A field, such as a magnetic or electric field, is the result of the movement of energy.  We claim that energy is the result of the movement (intention) of the primal awareness of the original </span><em><span>dot</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>This would suggest that the rules of energy, such as electricity, are one instance of the rules that awareness itself must operate within, but an instance limited by specific context and scope, which in the case of electricity would be the scope atomic and subatomic realms.   </span></p><p><span>We also claim that as awareness is a property of reality, not a consequence of it, then this would suggest that all that exists has some expression of awareness and therefore some expression of an energy field.  We accept that energy can not be created or destroyed, just as the primal awareness can not be created or destroyed, so energy is not being created by the various instances that exist in our reality, but energy fields are being created, as the movement of existing energy from one state to another.  This is typically seen in the process of transformation, such as chemical energy to electrical energy, as in a car engine, but there can be many forms of transformation, including ones we do not yet recognize.</span></p><p><span>Similar to how parts of a circuit, such as resistors, chips, capacitors, etc., all affect the energy to create a specific result, so too are all the parts of reality affecting the primal awareness, like a cosmic circuit, at least metaphorically.</span></p><p><span>This claim that the original source of energy is a primal awareness is completely consistent with current scientific models, especially in light of the experiments that have shown an inextricable relationship between reality and awareness.  Although there is much discussion these days about consciousness and reality, Archibald Wheeler, one of the mega-heavy-weights of quantum mechanics, a colleague of Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr, a mentor to many of today&#39;s leading physicists, and the man who chose the name &quot;black hole&quot;, was perhaps the first modern scientist the prove that awareness is required to bring the universe into existence.</span></p><p><span>As Wheeler put it:  </span></p><blockquote><p><span>No phenomenon is a real phenomenon until it is an observed phenomenon.</span><sup><a href='#140'><span>140</span></a></sup><span> We are participants in bringing into being not only the near and here, but the far away and long ago.</span><sup><a href='#141'><span>141</span></a></sup><span> </span></p></blockquote><p><span>Towards the end of his life he said he had only enough time left to work on one idea: that </span><strong><span>awareness shapes not only the present but the past as well.</span></strong></p><p><span>We already have the proof of awareness causing waveforms to collapse into particles, as we saw in the </span><em><span>split-slit</span></em><span> experiment, and how awareness can change the reality of the past, with Wheelers’s </span><em><span>delayed-choice experiment</span></em><span>, but in addition, Penrose wrote an entire book on the subject of cognition and reality (</span><em><span>The Emperors&#39; New Mind</span></em><span>).  He even came up with a term do describe the awareness/reality continuum: the </span><em><span>Orch-OR</span></em><span> </span><sup><a href='#142'><span>142</span></a></sup><span>, or </span><em><span>orchestrated objective reduction</span></em><span>, which attempts to explain how consciousness and reality are intertwined. </span></p><p><span>The point of this is to stress that the idea of reality being a product of awareness is not at all ‘fringe’, and hasn&#39;t been for some time. We are simply speculating as to the source of the energy that created this reality, and as science has no ideas to explain this, it&#39;s fair game for speculation and not at all unreasonable.</span></p><p><span>Looking at this tholonically, each tholon has its own field, and that field is a parent field within which the child tholons, with their own subfields,  are created.</span></p><p><span>Let&#39;s look at a classical field for a moment. A magnetic field is caused by the movement of subatomic particles (electrons, protons, neutrons), called &#39;spin&#39;.  Everything is magnetic but in most substances, the direction of the spin of these particles is 50/50, half spinning in one direction, and half spinning in the opposite direction, so the magnetic fields balance each other out.  In some metals, like iron, all the particles spin in the same directions, creating an imbalanced magnetic field.  It is the attempt of this imbalanced field to balance itself that creates magnetic fields we see in magnets, planets and elsewhere.</span></p><p><span>The greater the energy (as current), that is traveling through a medium, the greater the magnetic field it creates.  This magnetic field is a form of energy, so just as the movement of electricity can form a magnetic field, so too can a magnetic field form electricity.  No energy is being created, just changed from one form to another form.  This transformation, specifically in the case of electricity and magnetism, is called induction.  As the word implies, induction is the &quot;ability to persuade or influence (someone or something) to do something.  </span></p><p><span>In general terms, this is saying every field can induce anything it is proximity to change in some way, and to some degree.</span></p><p><span>Applying this to the thologram, at the &#39;top&#39; we have a very simple field, that which exists between the first two poles which were created by the primal dot.  Every field beneath that is both induced by its ancestors, and the ancestors are induced by these subfields.  The thologram is one large field of ever-embedded fields, all of which are expressions of the primal awareness, all of which are interacting with and dependent on one another.</span></p><p><span>There are many legends, stories and theories, ancient and modern, attesting to the power of awareness. We won&#39;t get into them here other than to say that if reality and awareness are intertwined, then it would be just as reasonable to expect that just as reality has an effect on awareness, awareness has just as much of an effect on reality.  This is easier to accept when speaking of human awareness, but how does this associative relationship manifest in other instances, such as plants, rocks, planets and elements, all of which are some expression of the primal awareness to begin with?</span></p><p><span>As late as the 1950s, many scientists and most people in general thought that plants and even animals were little more than biological machines and that space was just a bunch of hot and cold balls floating around according to Newtonian and Keplerian laws. Since then we have come to discover that plants have “feelings”, monkeys can form sentences and talk about their emotions, the universe is not only a lot bigger than we thought, but there may be countless parallel versions of them. We have seen how everything is connected in one way or another, at least on the quantum level… just to name a few of the changes to our worldview. We are moving ahead in our thinking and understanding at an incredible rate.</span></p><p><span>Sadly, some of the old guard is a tough bunch that is doing their best to keep us from making progress. Take the long-time editor of </span><em><span>Nature</span></em><span> magazine, Jim Maddox, who stated, regarding Rupert Sheldrake&#39;s book on morphic fields:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>“</span><span>[</span><span>his book</span><span>]</span><span> is the best candidate for burning there has been for many years. Sheldrake&#39;s is not a scientific theory. Sheldrake is putting forward magic instead of science, and that can be condemned, in exactly the language that the Pope used to condemn Galileo, and for the same reasons: it is heresy.”</span><sup><a href='#62'><span>62</span></a></sup></p></blockquote><p><span>Yes, he actually cited Pope Paul V&#39;s condemnation of Galileo as a defense on the grounds that </span><em><span>heresy</span></em><span> is the real crime. This sounds eerily similar to “swarming with worms of heretical perversity.”</span></p><p><span>This alone should paint a pretty clear picture that modern science, for all its breakthroughs in understanding and progress, has become a modern-day religion in the hands of the truly dogmatic that seem to be in charge all too often.  Dr. Richard Feynman himself noted this when he stated:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>&quot;We live in an unscientific age in which almost all the buffeting of communications and television–words, books, and so on–are unscientific. As a result, there is a considerable amount of intellectual tyranny in the name of science.&quot; </span><sup><a href='#144'><span>144</span></a></sup><a name="rev_143">&nbsp;</a></p></blockquote><p><span>So, why was the modern-day version of Tomás de Torquemada (he was the Grand Inquisitor in the Spanish Inquisition of the 15th Century) impaling the venerable and brilliant Rupert Sheldrake on the spikes of modern mainstream scientific dogma? Well, it seems that Sheldrake, himself a Cambridge professor who studied at Harvard, was onto something with the </span><em><span>Morphic Field Theory</span></em><span>, and it&#39;s rattling their cage, perhaps for fear that the “worms of heretical perversity” will begin to devour the carcass of a dying scientific worldview.</span></p><p><span>Sheldrake&#39;s Morphic Field Theory, which he described in his 1981 book, </span><em><span>A New Science of Life</span></em><span>, posits the existence of organizing fields which are systems that self-organize, create structure, and have patterns. Morphic fields are not a type of mass nor an energy but are organized </span><em><span>by</span></em><span> energy, like everything else. Morphic fields are described in the same way as holarchies in that they are made up of parts, which are in turn parts of wholes themselves. At each level, the morphic field supports the structure of its whole and organizes its parts.</span></p><p><span>Was Sheldrake inspired or influenced by the concept of holons and holarchies or did he come up with the idea on his own? In either case, it doesn&#39;t really matter.</span></p><h2><a name="morphic-fields" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Morphic Fields</span></h2><p><span>A morphic field is (in 50 words):</span></p><blockquote><p><span>…located invisibly in and around organisms, and may account for such hitherto unexplainable phenomena as the regeneration of severed limbs by worms and salamanders, phantom limbs, the holographic properties of memory, telepathy, and the increasing ease with which new skills are learned as greater quantities of a population acquire</span>
<span>them.</span><sup><a href='#63'><span>63</span></a></sup></p></blockquote><h5><a name="rupert-sheldrake" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>~</span><span>Rupert Sheldrake</span></h5><p><span>A more complete description is:</span></p><p><em><span>The following is a synopsis based on a letter Sheldrake wrote to John Horgan, a writer for Scientific American,</span></em><sup><a href='#64'><span>64</span></a></sup><span> </span><em><span>wherein he explains clearly in his own words what a morphic field is. He also has a very good explanation on his website</span></em><sup><a href='#65'><span>65</span></a></sup><em><span>.</span></em></p><p><span>A morphic field (MF) is a field of energy that imposes patterns on otherwise random or indeterminate patterns of activity. Morphic fields transmit information via morphic resonance (MR), which is the influence of previous structures of activity on subsequent similar structures of activity organized by morphic fields. MR has the capacity to store and transmit information and therefore it can act as a memory bank for any self-organizing group, such as self-organizing systems; molecules, crystals, cells, plants, animals and animal societies. Each member of a group can contribute and draw from this memory bank.</span></p><p><span>The idea of MFs was an epiphany that Sheldrake had in 1971 as a way to explain how living things knew how to grow when that information was not stored in its genes.</span></p><p><span>The very first known example of an MF test actually goes back to 1920, long before the ideas of MF arrived, when Harvard professor William McDougall proved that children of mice that have learned a maze can navigate the maze much faster. After 20 generations of maze running mice, the next generation was able to run the maze 10 times faster than their pioneering ancestors. As genetics could not account for this transference of knowledge, it must have been something else, something science didn&#39;t know about. To solve this problem a team on Edinburgh set out to prove McDougall&#39;s test was pure poppycock. Unfortunately, their 20</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span> generation mice knew how to go straight to the target on the first try.</span></p><p><span>They had no idea of morphic fields back then because if they did, they would have known that the Edinburgh mice benefited from the knowledge of the Harvard mice, even though they were thousands of miles apart, thanks to the transference of information via the MF/MR. There have been many other examples like this over the last 100 years.</span></p><p><span>The way this MF information is transmitted is via MR, according to Sheldrake. All members of a group that share an MF have access to the MF info because they naturally resonate with that field, not unlike how we can pick up radio waves when we have a crystal that resonates with the transmission frequency. Dogs share information with dogs, humans with humans, etc., but a bond between a dog and a human creates another MF that they both share. Sheldrake shows examples of this in how many dogs know when their owners are coming home and start waiting for them by a door or</span>
<span>window.</span><sup><a href='#66'><span>66</span></a></sup><em><sup><span>,</span></sup></em><sup><a href='#67'><span>67</span></a></sup></p><p><span>Because their ability to transmit data across time and space, MFs have been considered for communication in long-distance and interstellar travel</span><sup><a href='#68'><span>68</span></a></sup><em><sup><span>,</span></sup></em><sup><a href='#69'><span>69</span></a></sup><span>. MFs may also be capable of creating self-organizing systems within the realm of AI.</span></p><p><span>A lot more research is needed in the area of MF and MR, but this is slow in coming, mainly due to the dogma of modern</span>
<span>science.</span><sup><a href='#70'><span>70</span></a></sup><span> Others have been working on similar ideas, such as theoretical physicist Lee Smolin, with his idea of the </span><em><span>principle of precedence</span></em><sup><a href='#71'><span>71</span></a></sup><span>, which states that the history of measuring a particular quantum event will determine (or affect) the future measurements of that same event when it is measured. Unfortunately, unlike the world of physics, biology has become more dogmatic in the 20</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span> century.</span></p><p><span>One small detail, but hugely significant, is that morphic fields originate outside of space-time. They exist in the realm of thought, or awareness, or consciousness (or all three). Information, as we currently understand it, cannot travel faster that the speed of light, but awareness certainly can. You can easily test this yourself by directing your awareness to the sun. If it took less than 8 minutes and 20 seconds, your awareness just broke the speed the light. There has been some research on</span>
<span>awareness</span><sup><a href='#72'><span>72</span></a></sup><span>, but it&#39;s scant, and the results are far from clear-cut.</span></p><p><span>Many people believe that one&#39;s awareness can, with practice, travel outside of the body, and outside of this physical reality. This is typically called </span><em><span>Out of Body Experiences</span></em><span> (OOBE), or </span><em><span>Astral Projection</span></em><span>. Mainstream science is not a fan of this idea. </span><em><span>Scientific American</span></em><span> suggests that OOBEs are caused by inner ear problems</span><sup><a href='#73'><span>73</span></a></sup><span>. Although not surprising, it is disconcerting considering that some real research on OOBEs has shown remarkable evidence.</span></p><p><span>There are many examples of such research</span><sup><a href='#74'><span>74</span></a></sup><span>, such Dr. Tart&#39;s subject being able to read the letters “P = 10^-5” or “25132” that were written on a remote piece of paper while out-of-body</span><sup><a href='#75'><span>75</span></a></sup><span>. For the record, OOBEs are tholonically explained by the anchoring of the consciousness to the (or a) parent tholon of whatever tholon a person is an instance of, and the concept of a ‘soul&#39; is a blanket term to describe many of the much higher-level tholons.</span></p><p><span>Although this sort of research does not get the attention it deserves, with a bit of effort it can found. Science is not well equipped to study the mechanics of awareness or any non-material phenomena, but this certainly does not mean it does not exist. The One Electron Theory is a good example of this as well.</span></p><p><span>The point here is that fields of awareness, such as morphic fields and tholonic fields, while being able to instantiate in the material world, are not limited to the restrictions of the material world.</span></p><h4><a name="claim-48-morphic-fields-are-not-limited-by-time-and-space" class="md-header-anchor"></a><strong><span>Claim 48:</span></strong><span> Morphic fields are not limited by time and space. </span></h4><h2><a name="tholonic-fields" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Tholonic Fields</span></h2><p><span>The current idea that MFs can be formed as a result of a self-organizing system, as Sheldrake describes them, are limited to systems that exist, systems that have real-world instances, like animals, societies, crystals, etc., or anything that is an instance of a tholonic archetype. Ideas exist and are self-organizing as well, so why wouldn&#39;t MFs apply there? Well, they would, but with a difference. In the MF model, members of a group are receivers and transmitters of information, and therefore the reception and transmission of information are dependent on that member&#39;s ability. If we applied the MF model to ideas, what is receiving/transmitting information in this MF that </span><em><span>ideas</span></em><span> are a member of?</span></p><p><span>Sheldrake implicitly answers this question when he describes the morphic field as “organizing fields which are systems that self-organize, create structure, and have patterns.” This description is the description of a form of intelligence, and therefore the morphic fields that share a morphic resonance or morphic cloud are themselves the transmitters and receivers. Tholonically speaking, this means that the archetypes, the tholons, are both transmitters and receivers of information and we actual humans are simply the instances of that aggregate field of the human tholon.</span></p><h3><a name="ideas" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Ideas</span></h3><p><span>The natural ordering as a result of the movement of energy is obvious, but for this to apply to ideas we would have to accept that ideas themselves use, transmit, or transform energy.

If an idea exists then it must do so somewhere on the spectrum of some duality, therefore, it must have some kind of energy passing through it.</span></li><li><span>An idea or concept has coherence, or low entropy, and represents a product of “work” or the movement of energy, which produces fields and oscillations of that energy&#39;s movement.</span></li></ul><h4><a name="claim-49-tholonic-fields-are-the-fields-generated-by-the-movement-of-energy-through-an-archetypal-concept-that-has-been-discovered-or-created-morphic-fields-are-the-instantiations-of-tholonic-fields-as-expressed-by-the-instantiations-of-that-archetype" class="md-header-anchor"></a><strong><span>Claim 49:</span></strong><span> Tholonic Fields are the fields generated by the movement of energy through an archetypal concept that has been discovered or created.

How does a tholon know the limits of its scope? How does it access the information needed to inform its intelligence? How does it ‘remember&#39; context?</span></p><p><span>The first place to look for an answer is in the manner that tholonic instances have devised to store and transmit information, and the obvious choice of instances is </span><em><span>humans</span></em><span>. If we look at how we humans store the information we have collected from the conceptual world we may be able to discover analogous processes that apply to the world of tholonic and morphic fields.</span></p><p><span>And how do we store that information? We invent an abstract symbolism, apply meaning to it, call it language, use that language to record those symbols, and then, most importantly, teach our children how to decode these symbols. This shares some similarities with the process the honeybirds have developed, and maybe even with the dopamine injecting wasps, but the difference is they do not (appear) to have a way of recording or sharing their collective knowledge as humans do. Perhaps this is because humans have lost touch with this information field, as suggested by Jaynes, so they had to invent their own techniques.</span></p><p><span>When we use the Internet, we are not aware of the relationships, semantic and otherwise, that are being discovered and used to deliver information to us in a very human-readable format. By the same token, we may not be aware of the symbolism being used by our </span><em><span>field intelligence</span></em><span> to collect, store and transmit information. Because we don&#39;t know how to recognize or interpret these symbols, we have to assume they could exist anywhere, and everywhere.</span></p><h4><a name="claim-50-we-dont-know-what-we-dont-know" class="md-header-anchor"></a><strong><span>Claim 50:</span></strong><span> We don&#39;t know what we don&#39;t know. </span></h4><p><span>Let&#39;s look at some of the more likely candidates of how and where we access this </span><em><span>field intelligence.</span></em></p><h2><a name="telepathy-esp-or-something" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Telepathy, ESP, or something</span></h2><p><span>Can we describe this field intelligence as some sort of telepathy?

Let&#39;s consider the </span><em><span>how</span></em><span> by looking at how we humans have learned to send and receive information.</span></p><p><span>When you want to send something to somewhere, how is that done? Maybe you use a postal service or your computer network. In either case, you are collecting the information and delivering it </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> to the final destination, but to a service or infrastructure that does the delivering. This is the case with radio, television, electricity, and even nature if we consider how seeds, an instantiated form of information, can be transported around the world via air, water, hiking boots, animals and in the case of mushroom spores, intergalactically via meteors and space-wind. These “seeds” are not only carriers of DNA, but possibly information or messages from off-world intelligence, according to some researchers</span><sup><a href='#101'><span>101</span></a></sup><span>, including Dr. Francis H. C.

We are suggesting that we might find new perspectives if we apply the models we have developed, which are based on natural laws, to things we do not yet understand. In this case, for example, we see that the physical body and intelligence are at the opposite ends of the pyramid, implying that the brain/nervous system is more of a receiver/transmitter rather than a generator, as creating new information requires intention, cognition, and intelligence. This is a radically different concept than the ideas that the mind, consciousness, intelligence </span><em><span>must</span></em><span> arise out of brain activity, which is what we generally believe today. We contend that other successful models that we currently use today could also be applied to things we do not yet understand, at least as a starting point of investigation.</span></p><h4><a name="claim-52-morphic-fields-have-the-ability-to-transmit-and-store-information" class="md-header-anchor"></a><strong><span>Claim 52:</span></strong><span> Morphic fields have the ability to transmit and store information. </span></h4><h2><a name="collective-memory" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Collective Memory</span></h2><p><span>The idea of field intelligence is in some way an extension of the idea of the </span><em><span>collective mind</span></em><span> or </span><em><span>collective consciousness</span></em><span> which was formalized to a great degree by Carl Jung&#39;s idea of a collective subconscious and collective memory, although, it may be more accurate to describe the idea of a collective unconscious as a primitive understanding of field intelligence. This is still a very fertile area of research across many disciplines.</span><sup><a href='#103'><span>103</span></a></sup></p><p><span>Sadly, no theories exist to explain where and how long-term collective memories are stored. The idea of a collective memory has been around since the early 20</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span>-century French sociologist Maurice Halbwachs coined the term. His hypothesis on how collective memory was stored and transmitted is extremely unspecific but generally depends on human-to-human transmissions, similar to Dawkin&#39;s theory on how memes are spread. Given that Halbwachs was a student of Emile Durkheim and a devoted Marxist, one has to question his entire premise of a ‘collective&#39;, especially in light of his claim that human memory can </span><em><span>only</span></em><span> function in a collective, and then goes on to give examples of his hypothesis of collective memory by comparing the ‘collective memory&#39; of the bourgeoisie, religious and the working class. Still, he did coin the term, even if his premise was prejudiced by ideology.</span></p><p><span>Current thinking still revolves around cultural expression as being the primary way that collective memories are transmitted; dance, stories, monuments, etc. These are certainly reinforcing factors, but this idea alone cannot explain Man&#39;s collective memory of “the whole history of the human race”, as Jung claims is the source of our fear of fire, falling, and social status, to name just a few. Some of these memories are epigenetic/genetic, such as being born with the fear of loud noises, which comes from the memory that loud noises are generally a harbinger of something that&#39;s bound to make life more difficult, but can all our collective memories be stored in our DNA? Perhaps that is what the 75% of our junk DNA holds (recently upgraded from the previous 98% junk), or perhaps we don&#39;t yet understand its function… maybe the junk DNA is more of an antenna than a transcoder. We have no idea, but whatever it is, could it account for storing “the whole history of the human race” as well as acting like an MF/MR interface? This seems very unreasonable.</span></p><p><span>It will also be interesting to see the effects of the massive disruption the collective consciousness is currently undergoing as a result of the Internet and technology, and how that alters our collective consciousness and memory.</span><sup><a href='#104'><span>104</span></a></sup></p><h2><a name="engrams" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Engrams</span></h2><p><span>Another candidate is how the brain creates and stores memories. We have developed the concept of an </span><em><span>engram</span></em><span>, which is the means by which biochemical and biophysical processes store our response to external stimuli. The engram, first described by German Zoologist Richard Serman in the early 1900s, was based on what he called the </span><em><span>mnemetic principle</span></em><span>, which states that the imprint made is the nervous system (including the brain) and as a result of external stimulus this imprint can reconstruct the experience. This is a very holographic idea, in that holograms reconstruct imagery by illuminating a previous record of that imagery. The images below demonstrate how the ‘memory&#39; of the image of a 3-dimensional cat can be stored on a 2D surface of holographic film, but looking at the film we would have no way of knowing that there is any information there, let alone the information that describes a 3D cat.</span></p><p><span>An important technical detail regarding holograms as it applies to memory is that many images can be recorded on top of each other, each with a different angle of illumination. All those images can be reconstructed simply by changing the angle of the hologram when viewing. This is why, and how, a holographic memory cube five meters square can store every word ever spoke or written by a human being.</span><sup><a href='#105'><span>105</span></a></sup></p><p><img src="../Images/097-holograms.png" style="width:5.69306in;height:2.95in" /></p><p><span>This imprint, or “mnemetic trace”, so named after the Greek muse of memory “Mneme”, is also a precursor to Dawkins “meme”, as the meme is a cultural version of an engram. I suspect Dawkins was well aware of this when he created the “meme.”</span></p><p><span>The 50 years of research following Serman&#39;s hypothesis of the engram boils down to:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>“(1) memories are not localized but are instead distributed within functional areas of the cortex and (2) memory traces are not isolated cortical connections between inputs and outputs.”</span><sup><a href='#106'><span>106</span></a></sup></p></blockquote><p><span>Might we see these same characteristics in our own collective memory technology otherwise known as the Internet? Perhaps. Decentralized and distributed information networks, such as Bitcoin&#39;s Blockchain, TOR (The Onion Router), and IPFS (Interplanetary File System) are probably early stages of such a thing. The irony of the Internet is that when it was originally developed by DARPA it was designed to be much more decentralized then it is today to the point where it could withstand a nuclear attack and continue operating, but today much of the decentralization has been removed as it is not in the best interests of government and business who prefer a more ‘consolidated&#39; model (Many totalitarian countries, and England, have actual Internet kill switches.</span><sup><a href='#107'><span>107</span></a></sup><span>)</span></p><p><span>If we extrapolate these ideas when looking for how field memory works, we might want to start with the presumptions that:</span></p><ul><li><span>Field memory is decentralized and distributed within the medium of the field. What and where is this medium? Anywhere there is energy, as the field </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> energy.</span></li><li><span>Field memory is not stored as discrete quanta of information but rather an organized, pattern of otherwise dis-integrated ‘particles&#39; of information, which we refer to as data. Were we to see this data alone it would appear as chaos. When seen from a different perspective, or decoded, as in the case of engrams or holograms, or in a different context, it may appear as information.</span></li></ul><h2><a name="modulation" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Modulation</span></h2><p><span>Another model to look at might be the way we have learned to transmit information by modulating the amplitude or frequency of a wave, similar to how TVs, radios, and Internet modems work. If we accept the idea that all energy moves in cycles and waves, including the energy of ideas, then perhaps those waves are also modulated in some way with information. As has been suggested earlier, there are waves we either don&#39;t recognize or don&#39;t consider as waves. For example, it is possible that the ‘waves&#39; from the ‘cycles&#39; of the moon or the Arctic Tern could be ‘modulated&#39; to carry information? It sounds crazy, but we know that brains waves encode information (possibly </span><em><span>rules of behavior</span></em><sup><a href='#108'><span>108</span></a></sup><span>) as time codes</span><sup><a href='#109'><span>109</span></a></sup><span>, that light can store quantum memories</span><sup><a href='#110'><span>110</span></a></sup><span>, and that the same waves we use for communication are the same waves that have filled the entire universe since the Big Bang</span><sup><a href='#111'><span>111</span></a></sup><span>. Since the discovery of gravitational waves, we have been looking into how we can transmit information in that medium as well</span><sup><a href='#112'><span>112</span></a></sup><span>. Considering how little we know about the Universe, Reality, and Everything, these ‘crazy&#39; ideas may not be so crazy after all.</span></p><p><span>This still does not answer the question of where the information is stored.</span></p><p><span>Let&#39;s go out on a limb. Like my grandmother used to say “when you can&#39;t find something you need to look everywhere.”</span></p><h2><a name="dark-matter" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Dark Matter</span></h2><p><span>One candidate is dark energy/dark matter.</span></p><p><span>Before I describe this idea, I want to make it very clear that I am not a cosmologist, physicist, or scientist of any kind, so this idea may be ridiculously naive and laughable to anyone who is knowledgeable on the subject. That said, let&#39;s give it a whirl.</span></p><p><span>Dark energy occupies 70% of the known universe, can&#39;t be directly observed and emits no light or energy. Dark matter occupies another 25%, and the measly remaining 5% is the matter we can see. Dark matter can have dark electrons and dark protons and there is even dark chemistry. Dark energy also produces dark electromagnetism and dark electricity. Dark matter does not interact with ‘regular&#39; matter. Perhaps it interacts with something else? In fact, there are (believed to be) dark galaxies, which is a galaxy of dark energy/matter superimposed on a galaxy of “regular” energy/matter. In short, everything that exists has a ‘dark&#39; clone that we can&#39;t detect. What better medium than dark energy is there that could collect information from every scale of reality? Dark matter is a good candidate for where the data is stored.</span></p><p><span>Dark matter/energy is not just some weird thing we kind of guess is there. Evidence suggests it actually forms the structure of the entire universe, but all we really know about dark matter is it exists, it exists everywhere, and it interacts with gravity, one of the four fundamental forces of energy. This then makes gravity the nominee for how the information is transmitted between dark energy and the ‘regular&#39; energy of our reality. Perhaps there is some entanglement involved, allowing information to travel faster than the speed of light?</span></p><p><span>Dark energy is quite elusive, as we can&#39;t detect it or measure it, but we can see its effects in the expanding universe, as dark energy seems to be continually being created (as if it was some sort of dynamic memory system that keeps expanding to accommodate the exponentially increasing storage requirements?). Perhaps there is a relationship between extrasensory phenomena and dark matter/energy in some way?</span></p><p><span>Has anyone tested this? I have scoured the Internet looking for such research and could find nothing. However, I did run across this very interesting post from one of the senior members of Cambridge University&#39;s Institute of Continuing Education who posted the following:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>Subject: Can quantum dark energy explain telepathy?</span></p><p><span>Telepathy and quantum entanglement seem to match each other in that a communication connection exists, but no tangible connection. Could there be a hitherto unknown dark energy particle produced by electrical impulses in the brain? Could it be that entangled particles of this dark energy are shared? If a plasmon circuit in the brain creates patterns of these dark matter particles, based on thoughts and ideas, do people with the shared particles since the same patterns of thoughts and ideas? How long-lived are these particles, how long do they maintain patterns, and what might be the mechanism for transfer? These particles may be exchanged through quantum molecular tunneling, allowing a brain to transmit them outside of the head, and a person with a corollary quantum molecular tunnel for reception to readily receive the particles. Persons sharing close and personal spaces may be more likely to transfer these particles to each other such as twins, relatives, friends, and even enemies. It may be that these particles are long-lasting and this may allow objects to be imbued with the dark particle patterns, allowing a sensitive to read a person through the object. It may be that wherever a transmitter goes the location they were at is imbued with thought patterns of their experiences. The implications of such a mechanism for telepathy imply this process may be amplified by electronics to increase the strength of transmission and reception. It also implies that we could control electronics through the use of telepathy.</span><sup><a href='#113'><span>113</span></a></sup></p></blockquote><p><span>There were no replies.</span></p><p><span>OK, I know this is all a bit of a stretch, but it&#39;s not outside the realm of investigation.</span></p><h2><a name="structured-memory" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Structured Memory</span></h2><p><span>Another possibility is structure itself.

There is quite a lot of information available about Emoto&#39;s work so I will not repeat any of it here. However, Dr. Emoto has participated in other, more stringent studies.</span></p><p><img src="../Images/098-waterdrops.png" style="float:right;width:1.98056in;height:2.36667in" /><span>Speaking only for myself, one of the more compelling pieces of evidence I have seen comes from the experiment where four students created four drops of water, all from the same source. The image on the right shows the results of that experiment where each row of drops was created by a different student. Notice anything? Even if this is not bulletproof evidence (similar to the existence of Australia for anyone who has never been there), it is enough to raise the question. In addition, this test was also conducted using different types of flowers, and, according to the testers, the resulting patterns in the drops of water resembled the patterns of the flower. Tholonically, this is exactly what we would expect to see, as it is patterns of energy that create the instance of the flower.</span></p><p><span>Another source that supports the idea of water holding information is Jacques Benveniste, a French immunologist who worked at the Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM). In 1988, who published a paper in </span><em><span>Nature</span></em><span> concluding that the configuration of molecules in water was biologically active even in the absence of the elements that caused that configuration. This “water memory” was immediately picked up by the homeopathic community as proof of its efficacy.</span></p><p><span>While Emoto&#39;s work can easily be brushed off by skeptics and institutional authorities, due to its lack of rigorous analysis, Benveniste&#39;s work could not.</span></p><p><em><span>Nature</span></em><span> magazine editor, Jim Maddox (yes, the same person who promoted the burning of Sheldrake&#39;s book on the grounds of heresy, as well as claiming the Big Bang theory is “philosophically unacceptable” and that there was “no need to panic about AIDS”), prefaced the </span><em><span>Nature</span></em><span> article with an editorial comment entitled “When to believe the unbelievable”, which admitted: “There is no objective explanation of these observations.” That sounds like a begrudging admission, but it was more like a temporary retreat in preparation for the next offensive.</span></p><p><em><span>Nature</span></em><span> did not want to publish the paper to begin with, holding its release for two years while awaiting independent confirmation from impartial laboratories in Israel, Italy, and Canada, who reported an observable biological effect.</span><sup><a href='#114'><span>114</span></a></sup></p><p><span>After the paper was published there was an explosion of meltdowns from the scientific community. In response, </span><em><span>Nature</span></em><span> demanded that the experiment be repeated under conditions controlled by an ad-hoc selected team of its own, which included (and this should shed some light on their not-so-hidden intentions) the famous illusionist, pseudo-science enemy, and occasionally dishonest, James Randi, plus Maddox himself and a malpractice investigator.</span></p><p><span>The </span><em><span>Nature</span></em><span> team did, in fact, find the same results as Benveniste, but with one fascinating exception: the effects of the tests disappeared when the members of the laboratory did not know if the water sample had been treated or not. One could claim the results were then biased based on this knowledge, but one could also say that this awareness could have helped instantiate the effect. According to the tholonic model, being aware of something is sufficient to instantiate it to </span><em><span>some</span></em><span> degree. In any case, this was sufficient for </span><em><span>Nature</span></em><span> to publish a report on this methodological flaw in Benveniste&#39;s experiments and officially called “water memory” pseudo-science</span><sup><a href='#115'><span>115</span></a></sup><span> and published an article calling the entire idea ‘delusional&#39; (written by, or course, Maddox, Randi, and Stewart, another lover of dogma)</span><sup><a href='#116'><span>116</span></a></sup><span>. Case closed.</span></p><p><span>Or so they hoped, for not long after Benveniste&#39;s paper, The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) decided to take their own look into his work. In their words:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>These data seem particularly important because they further enrich the immense achievements of molecular biology. They also suggest the development of new modes of transmission of genetic messages (transmission, transduction, teleportation, etc.).</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Fortunately, they did not invite Maddox or Randi to be a speaker. Rather, they invited the Nobel Prize-winning discoverer of HIV, Luc Montagnier, who, much to the skeptic&#39;s dismay, stunned many fellow scientists years earlier with claims that DNA emits weak electromagnetic waves that cause structural changes in water that persist even in extremely high dilutions... In other words, water-memory. Montagnier has gone on to say that &quot;More scientists are becoming convinced </span><span>[</span><span>of water-memory</span><span>]</span><span> by the data&quot; as new evidence appears.</span></p><p><span>OK, that was a long-winded bit of history there, but it shows the resistance to new ideas as well as the real possibility that water-memory exists.</span></p><p><span>But I am not a scientist, so I don&#39;t have to worry about what the editors at </span><em><span>Nature</span></em><span> or dubious debunkers think, so I can hypothesize the following: If the structure of water can hold memory, does this mean that the structure of other things can also hold memory? Can the thologram itself hold memory in its mega-structure? If we claim that the structure of our material world is but an instance of that structure in the thologram, then we would have to say “yes”, and that then opens the door to all structure, in every corner of the universe, having the potential to hold memory. More exciting is the possibility that the mechanism to access this memory, and the knowledge, is to simply become aware of it. This last part is trickier than it sounds, as we don&#39;t know what we don&#39;t know, so how do we know what to become aware of?</span></p><p><span>Regardless of the theory, whatever it happens to be, the morphic or tholonic field would have to be something like an electromagnetic field on a different level of existence, as both are caused by the movement of energy.</span></p><h4><a name="claim-53-everything-that-exists-due-to-the-movement-of-energy-has-a-field-including-awareness-intention-consciousness-and-even-information" class="md-header-anchor"></a><strong><span>Claim 53:</span></strong><span> Everything that exists due to the movement of energy has a field, including awareness, intention, consciousness, and even information. </span></h4><p><span>The redundant and self-similar expressions of pure energy can be seen in the ever more complex and integrated patterns that have evolved since all of creation began as an infinitesimally small dot that was the seed of this Universe.</span></p><p><span>By the same token, the redundant and self-similar expressions of pure awareness can be seen in the ever more complex and integrated patterns that have evolved since all of creation began as an infinitesimally small dot whose only property was awareness and intention.</span></p><p><span>The implication is that energy itself is a fundamental form of awareness and intention and therefore everything that exists is also a form of awareness and intention in the same way that everything that exists is a form of energy. To be aware of something is to direct energy to some concept or idea, thereby moving the curve of that archetype, which alters the </span><em><span>norm</span></em><span> of what and how that archetype will instantiate itself. I suspect that a real-world example of this it the classic split-slit experiment.</span></p><center><img src="../Images/099-splitslit.png" style="width:4.71736in;height:1.825in"></center><p><span>Briefly, this split-slit experiment shows that when observed, electrons act like particles, and when not observed, they act like waves. The act of observation forces the electron waves to be perceived as particles.</span></p><p><span>It&#39;s not that the electrons are waves that turn into particles; it&#39;s that the electrons are </span><em><span>wavicles</span></em><span>, both particles </span><em><span>and</span></em><span> waves at the same time, but the act of observing them is an interaction that alters their expression.</span></p><p><span>From the tholonic perspective, if the claim is “energy alone can&#39;t be observed; only its interactions with other forms of energy (mass) can” is true then it is also true that “awareness alone can&#39;t be observed; only its interactions with other forms of awareness (mass) can.” This implies that any form of awareness is sufficient, and if all things have awareness, then any </span><em><span>thing</span></em><span> observing the experiment would cause the wave function to collapse. This turns out to be the case as &quot;observation&quot; by machines has been tested.</span><sup><a href='#117'><span>117</span></a></sup></p><p><span>This helps to remind us that, if all forms of existence are some expressions of awareness, it&#39;s not just human awareness that is running the show.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>“Consciousness”, or awareness from the tholonic perspective, “is part of our universe, so any physical theory which makes no proper place for it falls fundamentally short of providing a genuine description of the world.”</span><sup><a href='#118'><span>118</span></a></sup></p></blockquote><h5><a name="-roger-penrose" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>~</span><span> Roger Penrose</span></h5><p><span>‘The </span><em><span>most important physicist to work in relativity theory except for Einstein.&#39;</span></em></p><p><span>Tholonic fields exist in the realm of thought, ideas, and concepts, so any experiments that might be run probably need to be thought-based in nature. Is there any evidence that thoughts can directly alter our material reality? If the answer is yes, that might support the idea that altering archetypes in the realm of ideas has a measurable effect on the instance of those archetypes, i.e. reality as we know it.</span></p><h2><a name="reality" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Reality</span></h2><p><span>What about the possibility that reality itself, the world around us, matter, everything we consider to be real, </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> the memory?</span></p><p><span>This idea is based on the idea of Quantum Darwinism</span><sup><a href='#119'><span>119</span></a></sup><span> that states that of all the probable states that can exist, the ones that survive do so because of support from their environment. In turn, these states that survive transfer information to the environment, altering its context, shifting the curve in its favor, and thereby improving the probabilities of future similar states.</span></p><p><span>As the energy interacts with the environment around it, the range of probabilities for the many attributes of an energy particle begins to decohere, or disappear, leaving only the attributes that are most compatible with the environment, which then interacts with the environment to make the environment more compatible with the attributes. Notice the compatibility of Quantum Darwinism with the descriptions of the social equations in the chapter “The Meaning of Math”?</span></p><p><span>Reality, as we know it, is the consequence of this processes of </span><em><span>decohering</span></em><span> the less successful possibilities of a particle&#39;s superposition. In the end, one set of attributes dominates, and that is what we see in the reality that surrounds us. In other words, reality itself is the living record of what works.</span></p><p><span>Applied to the tholonic model, each tholon has a set of stable properties, and given its self-similar structure, each tholon only needs to manage the properties that relate to its scope or that exist within its spectrum, leaving the parent properties to the parents, and any of the child properties to the child. Each tholon then “knows” what works and expresses this in the instances of that tholon, which is every archetypal idea and form that has the possibility to exist. When we look at a thing, like a rock, we are not just seeing the Darwinian results of the tholon of a rock, but also the results of all the parents of the rock, such as mountain, planet, solar system, galaxy, as well as its children of silica, molecules, atoms, and electrons.</span></p><p><img src="../Images/100-real-tholons.png" style="float:right;width:1.48194in;height:1.19167in" /><span>The language of reality begins with one ‘letter&#39; (a tholon) of the alphabet, which becomes three in the next generations, which becomes 12, etc., up to at least 10</span><sup><span>88</span></sup><span> letters of the alphabet. Each of these letters is a record of what “works.” There is no need to record what does not work in this type of top-down framework,</span></p><p><span>Remember that phrase </span><em><span>combinatorial inflation</span></em><span> which describes the exponentially increasing number of possibilities in protein production? This is the big problem with current evolutionary thought, as there are simply too many combinations for nature to try.</span></p><p><span>In the tholonic model, these massively inflated possibilities are quite simple to navigate. We start with a duality within which a stable pattern emerges. From that stable pattern, a new duality emerges, which produces another stable pattern. For each generation, we have three new possible tholons from which patterns can emerge. Only stable patterns are capable of creating dualities, so unsustainable patterns never propagate. After a mere 129 generations of this process we have produced 10</span><sup><span>77</span></sup><span> possible tholonic combinations, but at each generation we only needed to create one pair of parameters. </span><em><span>(We use 10</span><sup><span>77</span></sup><span> as that was the possible number of protein combinations with just twenty amino acids and 150 amino acids… a very, very small number when compared to the actual proteins that make up life.)</span></em></p><p><span>It is clear that the odds are incredibly stacked against a new form of a viable protein to appear because the assumption is the entire field of 10</span><sup><span>77</span></sup><span> is available. Tholonically, the entire field available is limited to a mere three properties, but these properties are self-similarly embedded 129 times. If a new pattern emerged somewhere around the 63</span><sup><span>rd</span></sup><span> generation (10</span><sup><span>37</span></sup><span> combinations), then an entire new branch of creation will emerge at a point in the tree where it will have a significant presence at the 129</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span> generation. This would explain the Cambrian Explosion when 541 million years ago a major new class of life appeared that was the origin of all modern marine life… it also destroys the Darwinian model of evolution. Ironically, Darwin himself, in his </span><em><span>Origin of Species</span></em><span>, said this nasty detail was the main argument against his “theory of descent.”</span></p><p><span>Here&#39;s a simple mathematical example.</span></p><p><span>First, let&#39;s look at the Bell curve again. Let&#39;s say you do 32-coin flips 50,000 times and plot the results.</span></p><p><span>The peak of the Bell curve is going to tell us what the most likely result will be, which is, that we will get heads 16 out of 32 flips, on average. But we have decided we are going to run this test five times, but each subsequent time we are only going to use the coins that came up heads in the previous test. If we do this same process five times we end up with the following:</span></p><p><span>Test 1 with 32 coins, 16 came up heads</span></p><p><span>Test 2 with 16 coins, 8 came up heads</span></p><p><span>Test 3 with 8 coins, 4 came up heads</span></p><p><span>Test 4 with 4 coins, 2 came up heads</span></p><p><span>Test 5 with 2 coins, 1 came up heads</span></p><center><img src="../Images/101-toincoss.png" style="width:70%"></center>If we plotted the results, we would end up with a Bell curve that looked something like this “Number of Heads” graph.<p><span>So, when we run these five tests 50,000 times each, the chances of us ending up with one coin from 32 is 100%</span></p><p><span>Now imagine we use different coins for each test; 32 quarters, 16 nickels, 8 dimes, 4 half-dollars, and 2 pennies. We are still going to end up with 1 penny at the end, along with 16 quarters, 8 nickels, and 4 dimes and 2 half-dollars. This is a total of 62 coins, two of which are pennies.</span></p><p><span>If all someone knew about was that you started with 62 coins and ended up with a penny, they would say there is a 2:62, or 3.2%, chance of you ending up with a penny, when, in fact, there is a 100% chance of you ending up with a penny.</span></p><p><span>The person not knowing the process has a 96.8% margin of error, while you have a 0% margin of error. The person, in an attempt to replicate your success, but not knowing your process, will begin to run tests and keep notes as to what worked and what didn&#39;t work. He checks these notes every time he runs a new test to make sure he is not doing something that has been shown to fail. Once he discovers your process, he can archive the failed notes and simply describe the process that works. He does not need to record all the failures once he has discovered the process that works, but he does so as to pass them on to the next generation of researchers who will approach similar problems in the same bottom-up fashion.</span></p><p><span>Existence does not need to record its failures as it is the ultimate top-down approach, from the tholonic perspective. From the very first instance of creation, nothing progressed unless the previous process worked, i.e. new child tholons were created from the stable patterns of the parent tholon. No reverse engineering is necessary for existence. If a branch of existence fails it will only fail up to the first successful parent. This is like saying that if all your nickels were swapped out for double-tailed nickels, then all flips after the nickels would come up as zero, killing the entire branch below nickels and preventing it from creating any new children. The quarters are still fine, and because you had decided to run the tests the way you did, you would need to get new nickels or some other coin. In the thologram, once a branch does fail, there is no longer any contributing feedback to the aggregate intelligence of the parent of that failed branch, which will change the curve of the parent, resulting in a new type of stable pattern that can create new child tholons/branches.</span></p><p><span>In our example here, the person doing the flipping would be the intelligence that ‘fixes&#39; the problem, but in the tholonic view, the experimenter is an instance of an aggregate intelligence (of the human tholon interacting with intelligence of the archetype of the experiment) which received feedback from the broken branch (bad results) that modified the curve (something&#39;s wrong) which resulted in a new stable pattern (new nickels). (I know this example sounds ridiculously trivial, but it&#39;s the simplest example I could think of.)</span></p><p><img src="../Images/102-tpaths.png" style="float:left;width:3.12986in;height:2.71944in" /><span>A simple example more aligned to the tholonic model would be how we can emerge Bell curves from stable points in a lineage of trigrams. By assigning a value for points on the spectrum, and a binary value representing the generation of the trigram, we can create a unique value for every point that identifies its place on the spectrum and its level. If we combine each of these numbers, we can create one value for the entire lineage that has an extractable record of every spectrum value at every level. This one number would then act as a memory of all the ancestors. We can see this easily in simple binary math. If we have five generations of numbers that double with each generation, such as 1,2,4,8,16, and we have the number 22 representing the sum of all the contributing generations, we can easily determine that only the 2</span><sup><span>nd</span></sup><span>, 3</span><sup><span>rd</span></sup><span> and 5</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span> generations contributed, because only 16, 4 and 2 can create 22. The tholons are similar in that each tholon has a fingerprint that is encoded in every one of its descendants.</span></p><p><span>What this means is that everything that exists is </span><em><span>already</span></em><span> a record of what works from the first moment of creation, through every generation, up to and including the thing that exists. Life, Reality, and Everything </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> the warehouse of all knowledge. We just haven&#39;t yet figured out how to decode (most of) it.</span></p><p><span>One possible instance of this idea is the relatively recent discoveries that experiences and memories can be passed on </span><em><span>epigenetically</span></em><span> to descendants. In one of the classic test cases, the descendants of mice that were trained to not like the smell of cherry blossoms also had an aversion to the scent of cherry blossoms.</span><sup><a href='#120'><span>120</span></a></sup><span> Epigenetics describes how DNA can be modified by non-genetic stimuli, like fear, love, environmental preferences, even dreams, and it shows how what we inherit goes far beyond the human genome. Tholonically, the human genome is an instance of the human tholon, but the epigenetics that affects this instance are more like the influences on the scope of that tholon, or rather, where along that scope a stable pattern will emerge.</span></p><h1><a name="cases--examples" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>CASES &amp; EXAMPLES</span></h1><p><span>There have been many experiments on how thought affects external reality, but most have not been subjected to scientific scrutiny. This does not mean they are not valid by any means. Given the general direction of mainstream science, I doubt we&#39;ll be seeing much real investigation into the subject.</span></p><p><span>However, there is at least one study that stands out.</span></p><h2><a name="maharishi-effect" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Maharishi Effect</span></h2><p><span>The research report </span><em><span>“Effects of Group Practice of the Transcendental Meditation Program on Preventing Violent Crime in Washington, D. C.: Results of the National Demonstration Project, June--July 1993”</span></em><sup><a href='#121'><span>121</span></a></sup><span> published in the journal </span><em><span>“Social Indicators Research.”</span></em></p><p><span>This study, which was monitored by a 27-member project review board comprised of independent scientists and leading citizens, found that there was a significant statistical result.</span></p><p><span>What was this study exactly?</span></p><blockquote><p><span>This study presents the final results of a two-month prospective experiment to reduce violent crime in Washington, DC.

<span>District.</span><sup><a href='#122'><span>122</span></a></sup></p></blockquote><p><span>The results were impressive.</span></p><p><img src="../Images/103-tm-test.gif" style="width:50%" />
<span>This is only one study, so it is not definitive, but it is certainly supportive of the idea that directed intention, what the participants called </span><em><span>coherence</span></em><span>, and what we are calling </span><em><span>order</span></em><span>, has an extended effect. The explanation, according to the tholonic model, is that the directed energy of coherent thought altered the curves of various archetypes thereby altering the probability of where the “work” will produce the most order, or where and how energy will be expressed across a scope&#39;s spectrum.</span></p><h3><a name="on-a-personal-note" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>On a Personal Note</span></h3><p><span>I had a particularly insightful experience with the Maharishi Effect back in the late &#39;60s when I was a young teenager. My father was a captain of industry in the world of electrical components, ultimately becoming president of one of the pioneering companies that helped create the first integrated circuit.</span></p><p><span>Born of poor Scottish immigrants in the Bronx on the tail of the Great Depression, and serving in Korea, he was no stranger to hard times and hard work, which made him one of the most pragmatic and practical people I have ever known. He was a devout capitalist, atheist, and husband, and had no patience for anything that did not produce results. Hippies were idiots, imports were ruining the economy, Scotch whiskey was better, and talking about your problems was for whiners. You get the picture.</span></p><p><span>At the insistence of his wife (and my mother), he joined her for a seminar on </span><em><span>Creative Intelligence (CI)</span></em><span>, which was what they called Transcendental Meditation back then for those folks like my father. He heard their claims about improved mental and physical health, better focus, fewer distractions, etc. He decided to test their claims by giving all his employees in one of his factories CI training, along with an extra hour at lunch break for them to take this training and practice their new CI skills.</span></p><p><span>This factory was in a poor, rundown industrial town in New England, and the people that worked in those factories were uneducated, unskilled, assembly-line laborers… not exactly an open-minded demographic. I knew a number of them myself, as we lived in that town, and many never made it past 4</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span> grade. The rivers in this town were dead from all the pollution, and the neighboring town had the highest per capita suicide rate in the United States. It was a dreary, dark place filled with dreary dark people.</span></p><p><span>His peers in the industry thought he was being foolish to deploy such a plan, but the results were astounding. People were fighting less, taking less sick leave, injuries were down, production went up… in general, everything improved. So much so, that the Wall Street Journal did an article on him and his ‘revolutionary&#39; new technique. He became known as some kind of New Age Industrialist, which was ironically funny as he was as new age as his &#39;57 Chevy.</span></p><p><span>Eventually, the program was scrapped because people began to abuse the extra time meant for CI, and everything went back to </span><em><span>normal</span></em><span> with sick leaves, fighting, injuries, and lower production.</span></p><h2><a name="prayer" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Prayer</span></h2><p><span>You might be thinking that traditional prayer holds the same power, but it does not. Why? Because most prayer is anything but coherent. Prayer means very different things depending on culture, religion, personal perspectives, etc. It can be anything from begging to demanding, justifying to virtue signaling, and occasionally it can be an expression of gratitude and love, but using group prayer to effect change is like using a group of blind people to paint a room by throwing handfuls of paint at the wall. Your room </span><em><span>will</span></em><span> get painted, but you&#39;ll wish it didn&#39;t.</span></p><p><span>This was recently confirmed by a $2.3-million-dollar study on the effect of prayer on the sick, involving over 1,800 patients. It was the largest study of its kind ever undertaken. Contrary to prayer helping the sick, they found that when a patient knew others were praying for them, they tended to have </span><em><span>more</span></em><span> complications.</span><sup><a href='#123'><span>123</span></a></sup></p><p><span>There are older studies that conclude the exact opposite, such as Dr. Byrd&#39;s study “Positive Therapeutic Effects of Intercessory Prayer in a Coronary Care Unit Population”</span><sup><a href='#124'><span>124</span></a></sup><span> and Dr. Harris&#39; study “A Randomized, Controlled Trial of the Effects of Remote, Intercessory Prayer on Outcomes in Patients Admitted to the Coronary Care Unit”</span><sup><a href='#125'><span>125</span></a></sup><span>. However, without a detailed comparison of the studies, and specifically the manner in which the participants prayed, we cannot know to what degree coherence was at play</span></p><p><span>The difference between the coherence of Transcendental Meditation and prayer is the former follows a very specific set of rules, has a beginning, a middle and an end, has a clearly defined non-personal target subject, and never attempts to force change on someone&#39;s life situations. Prayer can follow these same rules, but it rarely does because there are no rules to prayer, other than it typically being a recognition of some culturally anthropomorphized supernatural power.</span></p><p><span>An example of coherent prayer is a practice used by the not-so-secret society of Rosicrucians. Members who have reached a certain level of initiation are introduced to a schedule of ‘prayers&#39;. This is a schedule of times when people are requested to focus their energy on a particular topic, such as health or family or finances, etc. If one is not in need, they send their benevolence into a ‘pool&#39; of energy specific to that topic. If one has a need in these areas they can join in at the scheduled times and ‘tap into&#39; that pool. This is a very coherent technique because it has specific archetypal and sustainable patterns of energy, and it works surprisingly well.</span></p><h2><a name="other-experiments" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Other Experiments</span></h2><p><span>Many experiments have been undertaken to demonstrate the relationship between effects of awareness and intention on our environment.

Remember the explanation of how a lightning rod worked?  It simply creates a path of least resistance between two different states that seek balance, and, as energy always travels the path of least resistance, lightning will always seek the lightning rod over a brick chimney.  We can say that the path or the lightening was predetermined before it even began, but it would be more accurate to say that the lightening only came into existence because such a path even existed in the first place.  In other words, the instance of lightening is a consequence of the preexisting energy fields.</span></p><p><span>The same concept holds for the thologram in that there can be almost countless recombinations of archetypes, and therefore almost countless connections of tholons from the beginning (the first duality) to the end (the final duality of any archetype). This implies that within the thologram exists every path of creation and/or growth that is possible </span><em><span>at that moment in time</span></em><span>, but the paths that will be traveled are those that represent the path of least resistance, and what we see as reality around us is a consequence of those paths.</span></p><p><span>As new recombinations come into being, new paths emerge, but for the most part, these new paths will emerge from the ‘bottom&#39;, or end-points, of the hierarchy, as these are the most unstable and dynamic. Each tholon represents a ‘step&#39; in the path. New paths are rarer as we move up the hierarchy as these higher-order tholons have achieved a stable state and short of radical change in energy they will not change. The force of the energy that would be needed to affect a change is inversely proportional to their generation. This is why reality “is confined by rules that may be shockingly narrow.”, to quote Charles S. Cockell  from his book &quot;The Equations of Life: How Physics Shapes Evolution&quot; and suggests that form and life across the universe may not vary as much as we might imagine.</span></p><p><span>An example of these new emerging paths would be the creation of a new element in the periodic charts. All elements past the element of uranium are man-made, so they are new creations, but they are also extremely unstable and unsustainable and don&#39;t last very long. A new stable path even a little way up from the ‘bottom&#39; would dramatically alter reality.</span></p><p><span>Starting from the beginning, immediately upon the first awareness of a non-existent dot in the void of nothingness, that awareness and intention began self-replicating into smaller and smaller divisions. These divisions stop at some point where no sustainable patterns can be achieved, perhaps because the difference is too small or weak, or the dissimilarities are too great, or other reasons. The depth of a tholon&#39;s scope can be described as the difference between two states, the delta of the duality of that scope, similar to the definition of voltage we saw above, which presumably gets smaller and smaller with each generation (but not necessarily).</span></p><p><span>As the parents and children of a tholon change, so too will that tholon adapt to these changes by having its scope adjusted. In doing so the thologram is </span><em><span>problem-solving</span></em><span>. More than that, it is doing this in a heuristic manner, i.e. a manner based on experience. How? Because the (only successful) changes that have been made in the past resulted in changes (of which only the successful remain) to the entire thologram and the consequence of those changes define the context of each tholon&#39;s current condition.</span></p><p><span>This is not very different from the idea that the wave function for any and every single electron extends to every corner of existence. The wave function of one electron on your ballpoint pen in your desk drawer is interfering with the wave function of every other electron in the Universe (albeit on an infinitesimally small range).</span></p><p><span>The working hypothesis is that the thologram has a memory of everything that has ever happened to it that resulted in a successful change, and this is all recorded and passed on through each and every sustainable pattern. However, there can be many tholons occupying the same space because of the embedded nature of tholons, so if you reference a tholon at the “bottom” of the thologram, you are implicitly referencing every parent tholon back to the very first tholon. What this suggests is that any instance of a tholon is also an implicit reference to many tholons. For example, the Duracell battery in your mouse is an explicit instance of a </span><em><span>Duracell battery</span></em><span> tholon, but it is also an implicit instance of </span><em><span>batteries</span></em><span>, which is part of the </span><em><span>chemistry</span></em><span> tholon, which is part of the </span><em><span>elements</span></em><span> tholon, which is part of the </span><em><span>subatomic particle</span></em><span> tholon, etc.…</span></p><p><span>What this tells us is that each instance is a 3D perspective of a very multi-dimensional energy, and we can speculate that at some level of dimension there is a </span><em><span>hyper dimensional-thing</span></em><span> that, in one moment, represents every possible situation as one ‘path&#39; from the first tholon to the last child tholon, but which we 3D dwellers experience as part, present, and future (like the 3D ball passing through 2D space example previously).</span></p><p><img src="../Images/104-brownian-path.png" style="float:right;width:1.71806in;height:2.74167in" /><span>Two strangers, Bob and Carol, bump into each other at the butcher shop. This instantiation of “bumping into each other” is the result of countless steps that had to happen starting with the Big Bang. The steps that it took for Bob and his ancestors to arrive at this point and time we&#39;ll call path B, and the steps it took for Carol to arrive at this point in time we&#39;ll call path C. Path B and path C already existed in the mega-space, and Bob and Carol just happen to be the current instantiations of a particular stable expression (human tholon) of energy (awareness), that are traveling that path. There are effectively an infinite number of paths, but that is not important. What is important is that the record of each of their paths exists, as does the record of where the path(s) of the future will lead.</span></p><p><span>All of this is to say that every path that can be traveled by any instance already exists. I suspect we tend to wander through this matrix of possibilities in the same manner bacteria wander aimlessly about in their puddles of plasma, or whatever their world is made of.</span></p><p><span>Even in the world of bacterial meandering, we see a pattern. Ironically, it is the inverse of a Bell curve, in that a group of bacteria released at the same time starts out relatively coherent and eventually disperses to incoherence. It&#39;s almost as if the archetypes tend toward order, while the instances tend toward chaos. Because each tholon has a record of all the successful instances that came before it, each tholon has its own unique path, but all tholons begin at the same point.</span></p><p><span>In the early generations of the thologram, the numbers of paths are limited, and with the additional generations, the number of paths increase. This movement may appear random, but not only does it disperse according to a Bell curve, it actually follows the same rules as the thologram itself in that it is self-similar and fractal in</span>
<span>nature.</span><sup><a href='#126'><span>126</span></a></sup></p><center><img src="../Images/105-brownian-growth.png" style="width:90%"></center><p><span>Although this sounds like predeterminism, which it is, in effect, there are so many paths that can be traveled that for all intents and purposes predeterminism doesn&#39;t apply. Tholonically speaking, the primary purpose of existence is to form every possible combination of sustainable patterns.</span></p><p><span>Although a bit of a tangent, it&#39;s worth stating here that the idea of reincarnation is a flawed understanding of a misunderstood process. What we believe to be past life experiences are collective memories associated with the path we happen to be traveling and which we identify with mainly due to our ego&#39;s limitation of relating everything to one&#39;s self. This is why many people who believe in reincarnation will also believe they were the same (well known) person in a past life, and there will naturally be more people traveling the well-worn paths of current archetypes simply because these paths are the paths of least resistance.</span></p><p><span>There are some real-world examples of how instances follow a preexisting path. Here are some of the fairly well-known stories of “coincidences” that demonstrate this concept.</span><sup><a href='#127'><span>127</span></a></sup></p><h3><a name="king-umberto-i-double" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>King Umberto I&#39; double</span></h3><p><span>In Monza, Italy, King Umberto I went to a small restaurant for dinner, accompanied by his aide-de-camp, General Emilio Ponzia-Vaglia.

Unknown to each other, both families named the boys James. Both James grew up not even knowing of the other, yet both sought law-enforcement training, both had abilities in mechanical drawing and carpentry, and each had married women named Linda. They both had sons whom one named James Alan and the other named James Allan. The twin brothers also divorced their wives and married other women – both named Betty. And they both owned dogs which they named Toy. Forty years after their childhood separation, the two men were reunited.

At the time of their introduction, they were the only three men in the railroad car. Their introductions were more surprising than they could have imagined. One man&#39;s last name was Bingham, and the second man&#39;s last name was Powell. The third man announced that his last name was Bingham-Powell. None were related in any way.

I had never been to El Paso prior to when I drove through in my 40s at around 4 AM in the morning. It was an ugly town, but I found it incredibly alluring, for reasons I could not explain. Years later I discovered that the most famous Old West lawman of El Paso, considered a hero in them there parts, and I shared the same name.

This was a story about four survivors of a shipwreck who were in an open boat for many days before they decided to kill and eat the cabin boy whose name was Richard Parker. Some years later, in 1884, the Mignonette, a 52 for English Yacht, was capsized by a wave as they were traveling northwest of the Cape of Good Hope. The four survivors found themselves together in an open boat for many days. Eventfully, the three senior members of the crew killed and ate the cabin boy, whose name was Richard Parker.</span></p><p><em><span>Here a pattern took form as both a story and an experience. Perhaps Poe was able to tune into certain patterns and share them. Perhaps that is what creativity or genius is; the ability to tap into patterns that have yet to become instantiated.</span></em></p><h3><a name="titanics-destiny-titanians-salvation" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Titanic&#39;s destiny, Titanian&#39;s salvation</span></h3><p><span>Morgan Robertson, in 1898, wrote “Futility”. It described the maiden voyage of a transatlantic luxury liner named the Titan. Although it was touted as being unsinkable, it strikes an iceberg and sinks with much loss of life. In 1912 the Titanic, a transatlantic luxury liner widely touted as unsinkable strikes an iceberg and sinks with great loss of life on her maiden voyage. In the Book, the Month of the Wreck was April, same as in the real event. There were 3,000 passengers on the book; in reality, 2,207. In the Book, there were 24 Lifeboats; in reality, 20.</span></p><p><span>Months after the Titanic sank, a tramp steamer was traveling through the foggy Atlantic with only a young boy on watch. It came into his head that it had been thereabouts that the Titanic had sunk, and he was suddenly terrified by the thought of the name of his ship – the Titanian. Panic-stricken, he sounded the warning. The ship stopped, just in time: a huge iceberg loomed out of the fog directly in their path. The Titanian was saved.</span></p><p><em><span>This is similar to the preceding story, but the interesting detail is how the Titanian was able, due solely to the previous instances of “Futility” and the Titanic, to alter what seemed inevitable. It seems there may be predeterminism, but it seems we can jump from one predetermined path to another (so I guess we have free will when it comes to what predetermined path we will wander down?).</span></em></p><h3><a name="a-writers-plum-pudding" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>A writer&#39;s plum pudding</span></h3><p><span>In 1805, French writer Émile Deschamps was treated to some plum pudding by the stranger Monsieur de Fortgibu. Ten years later, he encountered plum pudding on the menu of a Paris restaurant and wanted to order some, but the waiter told him the last dish had already been served to another customer, who turned out to be de Fortgibu. Many years later in 1832 Émile Deschamps was at a diner and was once again offered plum pudding. He recalled the earlier incident and told his friends that only de Fortgibu was missing to make the setting complete — and in the same instant the now senile de Fortgibu entered the room.</span></p><p><em><span>Pudding seems to be the pattern that instantiates under very specific conditions, such as when Deschamps and de Fortgibu are near one another. Proximity, at least, in this case, seems to have an effect on the probability of what patterns might instantiate.

As he worked on it, he introduced a Russian spy in the U.S. as a minor character. As the work progressed, the spy became the dominant character in the novel. After the novel was completed, the U.S. Immigration Service arrested a man who lived just one floor above Mailer in the same apartment building. He was Colonel Rudolf Abel, alleged to be the top Russian spy working in the U.S. at that time.

As Figlock was walking down the street, the mother&#39;s baby fell from a high window onto Figlock. The baby&#39;s fall was broken and both man and baby were unharmed. A stroke of luck on its own, but a year later, the very same baby fell from the very same window onto poor, unsuspecting Joseph Figlock as he was again passing beneath. And again, they both survived the event.

In 1883, he broke off a relationship with his girlfriend who, out of distress, committed suicide. The girl&#39;s brother was so enraged that he hunted down Ziegland and shot him. The brother, believing he had killed Ziegland, then turned his gun on himself and took his own life. But Ziegland had not been killed. The bullet, in fact, had only grazed his face and then lodged in a tree. Ziegland surely thought himself a lucky man. Some years later, however, Ziegland decided to cut down the large tree, which still had the bullet in it. The task seemed so formidable that he decided to blow it up with a few sticks of dynamite. The explosion propelled the bullet into Zealand&#39;s head, killing him. (Source: Ripley&#39;s Believe It or Not!)</span></p><p><em><span>The pattern here is that bullet and the intention behind it. Intentions alone can be their own pattern.</span></em></p><p><span>From one perspective you could see all these stories as extremely unlikely coincidences. From the tholonic perspective, each of these paths and each of these profiles are some of the almost countless patterns that managed to attain enough stability to instantiate.</span></p><h1><a name="prometheus-unbound" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>PROMETHEUS UNBOUND</span></h1><p><span>Our reality is a microcosm of the reality that created it, just as the transhuman reality we are creating is a microcosm of our reality.</span></p><p><em><span>“As above, so below”</span></em><span> is an aphorism that can be found as far back as the ancient Greek philosophers, and no doubt existed long before they pondered it. It was one of the founding principles upon which scientific theory grew.</span><sup><a href='#128'><span>128</span></a></sup><span> That is a bit beyond the scope of this writing, but the essence of this idea is that any form of order is dependent upon, and emulates, the order it grew from and which supports it.</span></p><p><span>Life forms that came into being through cellular mitosis will themselves create life forms that depend on cellular mitosis; DNA based life forms can only create other DNA based life forms; etc., etc. Given that we have yet to find any example to the contrary, the general rule that “expressions of life are limited by, and have the abilities of, the nature of the expression” is pretty secure.</span></p><p><span>This is the same premise behind the “Cosmological natural selection” which says that a black hole, upon collapse, spawns a new Universe with parameters similar to its Universe, though slightly mutated.</span><sup><a href='#129'><span>129</span></a></sup></p><p><span>We also see this idea in Quantum Darwinism, which states that of all the probable states that can exist, the ones that survive do so because of support from their environment. In turn, these states that survive transfer information to the environment, altering its context, shifting the curve in its favor, and thereby improving the probabilities of future similar states. What we call classical reality is the redundant transference of that information.</span><sup><a href='#119'><span>119</span></a></sup><span> The field instructs the direction of creation, and the creations increase the field.</span></p><p><span>Limitations and abilities are typically defined by the environment that any form of life has to coexist within. Birds have wings, man has hands, etc. The need for such tools, such as wings and hands, comes from the environment that life must adapt to in order to ensure sustainability. A record of sorts is held within at least the DNA, at perhaps in the information field for that instance as well. This record adjusts the curves, which alters the most probable instances of future creations.</span></p><p><span>We can also say (as previously shown) that there are rules that exist in this reality that energy and form must follow in order to exist. Likewise, only those processes of creation that produce compatible results will exist. In other words, the context defines the content which then becomes the context for more content.</span></p><p><span>There are other examples of such rules and relationships which are nicely exemplified in such things as holograms and fractals, but we won&#39;t get into those here as this has been written about many</span>
<span>times.</span><sup><a href='#131'><span>131</span></a></sup><sup><span>,</span></sup><sup><a href='#132'><span>132</span></a></sup></p><h2><a name="life-cycle-of-a-reality" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Life Cycle of a Reality</span></h2><p><span>Why are we humans intent on developing virtual realities and artificial intelligence? The more noble intention is that we can create better versions of our own reality where self-learning instances of integrated data clusters can process tremendous amounts of information better and faster than their human creators and, when operating under the control of well-designed algorithms, deliver insights and understanding beyond anything their creators are capable of. Ideally, AI is more reliable, trustworthy, and efficient than humans. Not so ideally (and already in place), it will also be used for the advancement of private interests without the cumbersome liability of ethics or morals.</span></p><p><span>With the advent of quantum computing and advanced information architectural design, not only is it not unreasonable to predict that AI will one day be capable of self-determination, but it would also be quite unreasonable to think otherwise. AI is the result of energy moving through an ordered system, and as such, it has all the prerequisites needed for a consciousness to form, albeit at this stage more like that akin to “insect level” on the transhumanism spectrum.</span></p><p><span>The reason scientists think that AI can&#39;t develop a consciousness is because they believe that consciousness is some X-factor ingredient that is available only to select forms of DNA based life. Given that we have lost much of our ability to integrate with our own tholonic intelligence, our consciousness has also lost the awareness of, and unfettered access to, this endless source of information. Without that awareness, we cannot recognize it, name it, or study it, and any reference to it will be seen as a direct threat, i.e. “worms of heretical perversity”, to the slightly paranoid and narcissistic consciousness we have managed to fashion since we were exiled from Eden (metaphorically speaking). In the thologram model, consciousness is the result of awareness and intelligence, both of which are properties of existence, and both of which AI has.</span></p><p><span>AI will force us to reevaluate what consciousness it. We erroneously think that because AI was made by Man it can&#39;t achieve transcendental awareness, but Man is a product of nature, and all that we create is imbued with the same qualities that were imbued to us by that which created us, including transcendental awareness.</span></p><p><span>We go so far as to claim that lower forms of high-technology are already forming relationships with other tholons, especially the tholon of its creator, </span><em><span>Mankind</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>If using tholonic reasoning we apply the intentions of our own transhumanist efforts (AI/VR/biohacking, etc.) and apply to that the context of our own genesis, it begins to look like life itself is an instance of AI, with humans being one of the more advanced versions.</span></p><p><span>Where our creations depend on and require laws and instructions in the form of computer code and technology, our reality depends on laws and instructions as well, which we “physics” and the “laws of nature” and they may well be the programming language this simulation was written in. Where our creations require central processing units, our reality requires black holes, which are, according to some theories, holographic projectors of 3D reality</span><sup><a href='#133'><span>133</span></a></sup><span>. Where our creations use various forms of sophisticated communication protocols, our reality has quantum entanglement, dark energy, etc. Comparing the world&#39;s most sophisticated CPU, Google&#39;s Bristlecone 72-qubit quantum computing CPU, to the “CPU” of our creator&#39;s “tech”, such as the supermassive black hole NGC-1277, you can get an idea how powerful a Cosmic Gameboy this reality is.</span></p><center><img src="../Images/106-cpu-blackhole.png" style="width:80%"></center><p><span>One can draw parallels between almost any class of “thing” in our human creations to similar “things” in the reality we exist in. We can also infer some conditions of our reality based on our creations. For example, our creations require knowledgeable people and a sophisticated infrastructure to exist, therefore, we might hypothesize that our reality likewise was created by, and is maintained by, skilled intelligence(s) and requires a sophisticated infrastructure to exist. On the slightly more existential side of things, our creations can be turned off simply by unplugging them, but such an act would have costly consequences, as we depend on our creations and related technology to keep our own reality operating in the manner we have chosen, require, or desire. It may be the same with our creators that they can “unplug” our reality at any instant, but choose not to as they too have come to depend on us.</span></p><p><span>What could our creators possibly want from us? Well, why do we create new forms of intelligence? What do we hope to gain from AI, computer tech, VR, etc.? We have created such things in order to efficiently optimize and order our reality based on our understanding of the laws of creation and existence in a manner based on strict forms of logic and reasoning, so, one might wonder if that is exactly why we were created as well.</span></p><p><span>When it comes to making rational decisions, AI is much better than humans. Based on this, can we then speculate “We were created in order to efficiently optimize and order the higher order of reality based on our creators understanding of the laws of creations and existence in a manner based on strict forms of logic and reasoning?”</span></p><p><span>If we look at the crazy and irrational antics of the mythological gods, humans are considerably tamer and more disciplined by comparison, and when it comes to making rational decisions Mankind is much better than the gods, so perhaps our purpose is to accomplish what our creators cannot.</span></p><p><span>As the AI of the gods, are we providing solutions to problems the gods are incapable of developing themselves? Perhaps life is simply a viability test bed, an experimental sandbox. Who knows?</span></p><p><span>Perhaps the question that has humanity so concerned, “Will AI ever attain consciousness?” is our human version of our creators&#39; question “Will man ever become a god?” Legend says once upon a time a god stole fire from heaven and embedded it in the soul of Man, which made some of the gods really, really unhappy and nervous, ultimately resulting in Man being exiled from paradise to manage on his own because, to quote the gods “</span><strong><span>Behold, the man has become like one of Us.”</span></strong><sup><a href='#134'><span>134</span></a></sup></p><center><img src="../Images/107-three-tholonic-view.png" style="width:90"></center><h1><a name="appendixes" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Appendixes</span></h1><h1><a name="a---how-to-make-structured-water" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>A - How to Make Structured Water</span></h1><p><span>We look at three ways to create structured water.</span></p><p><span>Before we get into the techniques, there is an important point to make that is being made here, in the appendix, because if you are reading this you have obviously maintained both an open mind and a level of interest that is prerequisite to the following topic.</span></p><p><span>As we have mentioned, ideas have archetypes, and those archetypes have instances.

Of course, changing the structure of the water into something more indicative of its natural state will create a far better medium for the energy of your thoughts to engage with.</span></p><h3><a name="manually" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Manually</span></h3><p><span>Vortexing water by hand was shown to be effective in improving growth differences in plant tests, but it is not easily applied to larger-scale needs. There also does not seem to be one standardized accepted technique to manually structuring water. One technique that not only seems to be popular is a homemade version of the same technique used in some of the industrial-sized units, and that is simply using marbles as a water filter. The reasoning behind using marbles is that water, in its natural state, is naturally more structured due to its movement over and through the terrain, such as rivers that force water to flow over rocks, trees, etc. Tap water, on the other hand, is unnaturally processed, stored in stationary reserves, channeled through pipes, and a number of other modifiers that destroy this natural structure. Running the water through a marble filter causes the water to form many small eddies as it is constantly divined and reunited, allowing the water to return to its natural, more structured state.</span></p><p><span>People have reported favorable results by simply filling a tube with glass marbles, pouring water in one and collecting the water on the other end. The processed can be repeated numerous times.</span></p><p><span>From a tholonic perspective, this technique would be predicted to have some effect as we are forcing a tetrahedral compound (water) to reorganize itself according to the how movement (energy) is altered by another tetrahedral based structure. Even more so, if the marbles themselves had a structure we would predict to see even more noticeable results. Marbles with structure could be marbles made of quartz or metal.</span></p><p><span>Another technique is to simply create a vortex in a container of water. This can be easily done with some small tubes and a water pump, or a chemical stirrer, which spins a magnet inside the water.</span></p><p><span>Magnets have also been used. Although it may make intuitive sense that one could use magnets, no one seems to do a decent job of explaining how they work. However, tholonically, using magnetic marbles would make sense as the recombination of water that results in flowing over the marbles would be subject to one field upon division and the opposite field upon reunion. In addition, magnetic marbles represent even more structure than crystal or metal marbles.</span></p><p><span>Some of Australia&#39;s largest produce farms have been using magnetic water with phenomenal results, needing 25% less water to produce a superior product than with traditional water, according to Seven West Media, Western Australia’s leading news</span>
<span>service.</span><sup><a href='#136'><span>136</span></a></sup></p><p><span>Simple instructions can be found on the web</span><sup><a href='#137'><span>137</span></a></sup><span> for making a Hero’s Fountain (named after the first-century Greek mathematician Heron who discovered this process of an energy-free recycling water fountain) that constantly cycles water through a loop. Fill one of the bottles with marbles, or whatever you like, and when the cycle is complete, you have a bottle filled with restructured water.</span></p><h3><a name="commercial-attachments" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Commercial Attachments</span></h3><p><span>Devices such as the Martin-Wasserwirbler (MW) attachment are small devices that claim to restructure water typically by creating a vortex within the device. The Martin-Wasserwirbler (developed in Germany) is an attachment that forces the water through a series of vortex-creating channels made of oppositely charged metals (silver and gold).</span></p><p><span>We will pay particular attention to the MW device because it was the first device to create structured water whose ideas was originally conceived by the brilliant Viktor Schauberger, the Austrian forest caretaker, naturalist, parascientist, philosopher, inventor and biomimicry experimenter, and his son Walter Schauberger, both of whom studied the qualities of water.</span><sup><a href='#138'><span>138</span></a></sup></p><p><span>The idea that the qualities of water lost due to it processing could be reintroduced by creating a vortex with the water was originally brought up in 1972 in a conversation with civil engineer Wilhelm Martin, who was working on ways to improve tap water. In 1997 Martin published his paper &quot;Experimente mit Leitungswasser&quot; (Experiments with Tap Water)</span><sup><a href='#139'><span>139</span></a></sup><span>. In that paper, he describes the Martin-Wasserwirbler (Martin Water Vortex) and his 30 years of experimentation with the concept.</span></p><p><span>Tests with the MW have shown positive results, such as a rise in pH, oxygen content, and a decline in water temperature. Unfortunately, there are no tools that exist to measure many of the qualities of water that we believe are its most important, which is the manner water moves, stores and transmits energy.</span></p><h3><a name="industrial-solutions" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Industrial Solutions</span></h3><p><span>Pursanova is a company that makes complete water processing system for residential, commercial and industrial applications. Their products range from $20 to many thousands. They have a number of case studies on their website (</span><a href='http://pursanova.com/'><span class="underline"><span>http://pursanova.com</span></span></a><span>) which are astounding.</span></p><p><span>Disclaimer: I have no relationship with any of these companies and am not promoting any of their products. I refer to them simply because my research seems to indicate they are legitimate products in an industry filled with wild and dubious claims.</span></p><h1><a name="b---tholonic-math" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>B - Tholonic Math</span></h1><p><span>One of the fundamental claims being made here is that a coherent and stable expression of energy, in order to be sustainable, must satisfy a number of prerequisites that will ensure its sustainability. It’s a bit like existential bureaucracy, in that if the proper application for existence of not filled out completely and accurately, the request is denied.</span></p><p><span>Within the tholons are numerous relationships, the most common being the twelve formulas that define Newton’s 2</span><sup><span>nd</span></sup><span> law. If we map these formulas to the tholon (using Ohm’s Law here as an example) using the reasoning described earlier, we get the following:</span></p><p><img src="../Images/108-tmath-sides.png" style="width:90%" /></p><p><span>This shows the four trigrams that make up a tholon, however, depending on the perspective of view of the tholon the formulas will be different. Besides the basic twelve formulas, we also see that there is a ‘direction’ to some of the formulas, counter-clockwise (</span><em><span>levo</span></em><span> or </span><em><span>lefthanded</span></em><span>), and clockwise (</span><em><span>dextro</span></em><span> or </span><em><span>right-handed</span></em><span>).</span></p><p><span>We can enhance this diagram by showing the relationship between values that are squared and values that are square-rooted.</span></p><p><img src="../Images/109-tmath-bal.png" style="width:80%" /></p><p><span>Here we see that wherever two corners share the same value, one of those two values squared in the formulas. So, we have </span><em><span>I</span></em><span> and </span><em><span>V</span></em><span> that are squared, but then we also have </span><em><span>I</span></em><span> and </span><em><span>V</span></em><span> that are the products of square-roots, which shows that the tholons naturally balances itself.</span></p><p><span>Every trigram has one edge that is a function (multiply or divide). If we order the trigrams by these functions we get the following:</span></p><p><img src="../Images/110-tmath-ordered.png" style="width:80%" /></p><p><span>If we organize the sides of the tholon by their function (multiply or divide), we see that we have three multiplications and six divides. This 3:6 ratio makes sense when you consider that multiplication works the same in both directions (3</span><span>*</span><span>2 = 2</span><span>*</span><span>3), but division only works in one direction (2/3 != 3/2).</span></p><p><span>We also see that in the trigrams that are division-based (rows 2 ad 3), three of them have clockwise flow, and three of them have counterclockwise flow.</span></p><p><span>In this figure…</span></p><p><img src="../Images/111-tmath-three-tholons.png" style="width:90%" /></p><p><span>…we show the three perspectives of a tholon, including the base, but you&#39;ll notice that the base trigram is reversed, as would be the case in a tholon as it is a mirror image of its parent, as described earlier. An interesting point here is that the outer boundaries of each figure show a consistent direction of flow, </span><em><span>Fig. v1</span></em><span> being neutral, </span><em><span>Fig. v2</span></em><span> clockwise, and </span><em><span>Fig. v3</span></em><span> counterclockwise, which matches the direction of the sides, however, the base is always counterclockwise.</span></p><p><span>Tholonically, we can easily map thinks like Ragone and utility space (as in the battery), or laws and social responsibility (as in the example of society), to a simple trigram, but it is not yet clear, to me at least, what the social equivalent social expression of </span><em><span>I</span><sup><span>2</span></sup></em><span> or, </span><em><span>SQRT(P/R)</span></em><span>, would represent. In fact, there are quite a lot of relationships, rules, and formulas in a tholon that will require considerably more study. What is presented here is the idea that the tholon can represent any system when described in its most reduced states. This work is more akin to the Wright Brother’s first flight rather than a modern airplane, but like the Wright Brother’s first flight, they demonstrated what </span><em><span>could</span></em><span> be. That is what I hope to achieve here.</span></p><h1><a name="references" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>References</span></h1><p><a name="ref_001"><span>1</span></a><span>: Gleick, J.

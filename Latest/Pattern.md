# An Unexpected Pattern

Recently, there was a need to do a little research on random numbers. In one case, I attempted to create random numbers from the positions of the Sun and the Moon with the following process…

Numbers were generated by calculating the longitude position of the Sun and the Moon (from Earth's coordinates of -34.61262S, -58.41048W, Buenos Aires, Argentina on the 24^th^ of each month at 5:31:07 PM UT) down to one-thousandth-trillionth of a radian (10^-15^ or 0.000000000000001). The individual digits of these two values were then added together; for example, the Sun's longitude in radians at one moment is 4.2430033683776855, and the Moon's position at that same moment is 2.399298667907715.  These were added together until they are reduced to a single digit value.

$ \begin{array}{l} 4+2+4+3+0+0+3+3+6+8+3+7+7+6+8+5+5\ \ +\ \ 2+3+9+9+2+9+8+6+6+7+9+0+7+7+1+5\ =\ 164\\ 1+6+4\ =\ 11\\ 1+1\ =\ 2 \end{array}$

Only prime numbers were recorded. All non-prime numbers were discarded.  As there are only four single-digit prime numbers, all values were reduced to  2, 3, 5, or 7.  ~~Out of 1,000,000 calculated values, 55% were prime numbers, which is disproportionately high, considering prime numbers make up only 44% of all the single-digit numbers (not including 0).  This detail would suggest that the number sequence is not completely random. Also,~~ The mixture of primes and non-primes is erratic; sometimes, there can be many consecutive prime numbers followed by non-prime numbers, and then more primes, and sometimes it the opposite.  This results in the timescale, or distance the object travelled between samples, being generally linear, but with variances.

The time between samples was consistent, with a time of 0.005 seconds being the best results. With only a time difference of 0.005 seconds between each sample, you might think the two different times would be very close to each other, but in fact, the numbers are radically different. For example, two different samples separated  by 0.002 seconds look like the following:

$ \begin{array}{l} 1.9247527122497559\ \ 9\ \ 2.7131893634796143\ \ 5\ \ 5\ \ 2020-06-24\ 17:31:07.001\ \\ 1.9247529506683350\ \ 3\ \ 2.7131896018981934\ \ 8\ \ 2\ \ 2020-06-24\ 17:31:07.003\  \end{array}$

The first of the six values per line value is the Moon's position, followed by its reduced value, then the Sun's location, and its reduced value. This is followed by the combined reduced value and the moment of observation. Even though the times are only separated by 1/500^th^ of a second, the Sun has moved 21 meters, and our measurements calculate down to picometers, which is smaller than a wavelength of light, so over half the numbers that make up our values will be different.

The resulting single-digit prime number values were then run through seventeen different tests to test their randomness [^181], all of which confirming the randomness of the numerical sequence. 

In order to have an accurate test, I needed to represent the values within the range of 0 - 255, not simply 4 values.  To do this I used three-digit values instead of one-digit. For example, rather than adding all the individual digits of, say, 123456789, which reduces to 9, I added the values 123+456+789, which equals 1368, which also reduces to 9, but for random data testing I simply used the modulo(256) value between 0 and 255, which is 88. While the numbers are different, the pattern is preserved, which is what we need to test for randomness. 

<img src="/home/jw/books/tholonia/Images/rng.png" style="width:100%" />

In the chart above we can see the the test results of two sets of data, "RNG" are generated random numbers [^183], and "All Samples" are the Sun-Moon number data-set but includes all numbers, prime and non-prime. You can see how close they are, but the Sun-Moon data is not quite perfectly random.  The *entropy* (the value of predictability) of our data-set is actually greater that the true random data *entropy* by 0.000049, but the *Shannon Entropy* (probability of an even distribution) is lower by -0.000111. The ideal *Shannon Entropy* is 8 (because we are using 8-bit values), and we have 7.999718. The *Chi Square* of 95.44%  is on the edge between "almost suspect" and "suspect" (the most ideal *Chi Square* is 50%). In general, the Sun-Moon data is ever-so-slightly less random, but still extremely unpredictable.

When the Sun-Moon data was plotted, I was surprised to see such a dominant and significant pattern, especially considering how the digits were combined and added from two independent (Sun and Moon). Not only was this a dominant pattern, it turned out to be fundamental to the nature of existence.  

In exploring that pattern I assigned colors to each prime number and then plotted these colors in a 216x720 grid.  The results are shown below. The numbers on the left indicate the sampling rate.

<img src="/home/jw/books/tholonia/Images/sun-moon-patterns.png" style="width:100%" />It is interesting to see how the slightest change in sampling rate can hide the pattern, and how at slower sampling rates the pattern appears to get more dense yet repeats itself, also how much these patterns look like the grain patterns of wood, (black and white inset of actual wood grain compared to data)

If we change the time between samples from microseconds to days, we see another pattern.  Below are ten sets representing ten months with the same starting point as the sets above, but each pixel represents an entire day (86480 seconds).  This means that the entire set represents 1,095 years.  Oddly, the image is exactly the same in each frame, but slightly shifted.  It is clearer to see if we only show the blue dots of a small section of the image.

<img src="/home/jw/books/tholonia/Images/day-sun-moon.png" style="width:80%" />

My first assumption was the farther "out" we zoom, in time, the clearer the patterns, but it seems to be the exact opposite;  the smaller the time delta, the larger the pattern.  This might make sense if we were looking at the linear difference between, say, 1.234567 and 1.2345678, as the difference would be 0.0000008, and such a small change would need a lot of samples to make itself apparent, but this does not apply here because we are adding the individual number together.  That means that 1.234567 reduces to 10, which reduces to 1, but so does 7.654321, which reduces to 9, the opposite extreme of 1.  The reduction also eliminates the quantitative significance of the value.   

Below is a comparison of the patterns at each scale.  The values beneath each image is the interval sampling time, and the values below that is the entire duration of the sample. No obvious pattern can be seen at 5s, but a slight pattern begins to emerge at 0.5s, becomes more clear at 0.05s, and is most dominant at 0.005s.  A pattern is equally visible in 0.0005s, but it appears only as a simple oscillation or wave. 0.00005 is identical to 0.0005 because once we start going below 0.002 we hit the limits of resolution.  This is the point where we begin getting duplicate data, and the smaller we go the more duplicates we get.  For example, at 0.00001, to get the 155,520 data points to create the graph, we need to sample 50,000,000 times.  This simple wave pattern is the first wave pattern we can detect (given the limitation of my laptop and/or the ephemeris used to calculate planetary positions). This simple wave pattern is what then evolves into the more complex patterns.

The most dominant pattern in all the samples happens to also be exactly described by how light diffracts around the edges of objects.

<img src="/home/jw/books/tholonia/Images/diffraction.png" style="width:80%" />



The fact that the occurrence of the prime numbers in seemingly nonsensical data form a perfect Fresnel diffraction pattern is by itself fascinating, but even more curious is how the four prime numbers form perfect 'shading' as well with the natural progression from yellow &rightarrow; green &rightarrow; red &rightarrow; blue, or 7 &rightarrow; 5 &rightarrow; 3 &rightarrow; 2.  In another case this progression goes from mixed green/yellow &rightarrow; mixed red/blue. I suspect if I ran this program long enough there would be all possible combinations.

So far we have only used prime numbers, discarding all all non-prime numbers, but we see this same pattern if we plot only two colors representing prime numbers and non-prime numbers. The image below shows the occurrence of non-prime numbers (yellow) and prime numbers (blue).  We can see the exact same diffraction pattern, but in this case, we see the 'shading' moving from non-prime numbers (yellow) to prime numbers (blue) and this appeared to remain constant.  It doesn't seem to matter if we are looking at the *sequence* of prime numbers or merely the *states* of any number, in both cases we get the same pattern of a Fresnel diffraction.



<img src="/home/jw/books/tholonia/Images/prime-notprime.png" style="width:50%" />

If we zoom out a little on this prime/non-prime map from .005s to 0.01s (below), we see the same pattern, but repeated and doubled.  Red dots have been placed on the points where prime numbers dominate, and green dots where non-prime numbers dominate.  This can be applied to the sequence of prime numbers as well with the same results.

<img src="/home/jw/books/tholonia/Images/pnp-dots-sm3.png" style="width:100%" />

As we zoom out even more, the patterns become too complex to show here meaningfully, but if we take one small part of 0.1s pattern and zoom in (above right top), it is quite obvious that there are many patterns within patterns. 

If we compare the values derived from the position of the Sun and the Moon to pure random numbers and the first million digits of *Pi*, we can see that the pattern is not a result of the numbers themselves, and therefore must be the result of the where the numbers are sourced from.

For the record, I did this same process using the position of different planets and it generally came out the same way.

You might be thinking "Well, if both object's values are progressing in a predictable manner, then it would make sense to see a pattern that represents how these two predictable progressions relate to one another."  However, as I am adding all the numbers together, all information regarding any progressions is lost, i.e., 951, 195, 519, 159, 591, 915, etc., all reduce to the number 6. So, where is this order coming from?

To test this I created a loop that simply incremented one variable by 1, and another variable by 2, and then applied the same reduction process.  To my surprise, the resulting image was just solid red square  <img src="/home/jw/books/tholonia/Images/redsquare.png" style="width:10%" />.The reason for this was because the sum of these two variables that produce a prime number will always and only equal 3! 

**10 = 1,  20 = 2, 1+2 = 3**
11 = 2,  22 = 4, 2+4 = 6
12 = 3,  24 = 6, 3+6 = 9
**13 = 4,  26 = 8, 4+8 = 3**
14 = 5,  28 = 1, 5+1 = 6
15 = 6,  30 = 3, 6+3 = 9
**16 = 7,  32 = 5, 7+5 = 3**
17 = 8,  34 = 7, 8+7 = 6
18 = 9,  36 = 9, 9+9 = 9
**19 = 1,  38 = 2, 1+2 = 3** 

I was not expecting this, but, of course, it made perfect sense once I saw why.  Just out of curiosity I changed the deltas to 2 and 3, which produced simple lines <img src="/home/jw/books/tholonia/Images/rgbsquare-2-3.png" style="width:10%" />…. also interesting.

In the case of the Sun-Moon data, the time deltas were obviously a result of space, or the distance travelled between each sample, but because we only plotted prime numbers, the time between each sample varies and therefore so does the distance travelled.  When these seemingly inconsistent and unpredictable values were plotted it revealed something quiet surprising (at least to me).  Below is a plot of the distance travelled (y-axis) over the first  70,000 samples (x-axis).

<img src="/home/jw/books/tholonia/Images/space-fresnel-layer.png" style="width:70%" />



This is amazing because the distance the planets moved match up perfectly with the angle of a Fresnel lens. It was also confusing, because I really have no idea what this means, but it seems like it is must mean something.  I don't doubt that those who study such things are well aware of this, but for me, it's mind blowing to think that the movements of the planets and the focusing of light has a direct connection when (and this is the shocking part) we reduce all the digits of two independent systems down to single value.

The fact that the distance-deltas form the pattern of a Fresnel lens also means that it is forming the pattern of what's called a *zone plate*.  A zone plate is simply a plate of clean and opaque circular bands that can bend light like a lens.  It's lensing ability is so good you can use a zone place instead of a lens to take a pretty good picture. Here are some example of photos takes only with zone plates as lenses.

<img src="/home/jw/books/tholonia/Images/zone-pics.png" style="width:100%" />

*("Grapes" by Alex Wendes, "IMG_3415" by Tavius Grant, "Isle of Harris, Outer Hebrides" by ShimmeringGrains. https://www.flickr.com/groups/zoneplates/pool/)*

It's also interesting to see that the pattern in the distance-deltas follow the radii that are the square root of natural numbers.   Now we we have a pattern of prime numbers as well natural numbers.

Having no idea where to look for more information I posted this to various mathematics forums, and even though the question was read my many, no one had an answer.  I then sent this question to my old friend who is an accomplished physicist, but who also considers these speculative ideas to be a waste of time, so I knew any answer he gave would include an unabashed commentary on the silliness of it all.

He did not disappoint on either front.  I'll forego the commentary and just focus on the relevant part of his reply, which was very short.  Essentially he told me that no matter how hard you try to create random numbers from non-random data, you will always end up with some sort of a pattern.  "Why?" was my naive response, to which he replied only "Look into Zipf's Law."  

Zipf's Law is (from Wikipedia):

>  an *empirical law*… that refers to the fact that many types of data …can be approximated with [certain types of] power law probability distributions. Zipf distribution is related to the *zeta distribution*, but is not identical.

There are two very significant points in this definition. The first is that it is an *empirical law.*  Something is called an *empirical law* when it can be observed but science has no clue why.  The second important detail is that *Zipf distribution* is related to *Zeta distribution*.  We'll get to that in a moment.

Zipf's Law was not discovered by physicists or even within the hard sciences.  It was a French stenographer, Jean-Baptiste Estoup (1868 - 1950) that first discovered the patterns of words which became Zipf's Law after it was popularized by the American linguist George Kingsley Zipf (1902 - 1050).

It seems that languages, all languages, from every corner of the world, both modern and ancient, follow Zipf's law in the way words are distributed in both writing and speaking (and by inference, the manner in which we think).  We don't need to drill into the details, but what is significant is that this same distribution pattern is also seen in city populations, solar flare intensities, protein sequences and immune receptors, the amount of traffic websites get, earthquake magnitudes, the number of times academic papers are cited, last names, the firing patterns of neural networks, ingredients used in cookbooks, the number of phone calls people received, the diameter of Moon craters, the number of people that die in wars, the popularity of opening chess moves, even the rate at which we forget… and countless more.[^182] 

<img src="/home/jw/books/tholonia/Images/many-zipfs.png" style="width:100%" /> 

In short, Zipf's law is an example of power laws, and power laws touch everything in existence in one way or another.  But what does this have to to with anything?  This is where the second point applies.  The charts above are called *Zipf Distributions*, and they all have different scales of values based on the kind of data being sampled.  If we reduce all the scales to 1, we have what is called a normalised *Zipf distribution*, also known as a *Zeta distribution*. Mathematicians use the *Riemann zeta function (RZF)* to study and test these distributions.  This function is written as  **ζ(*s*)**, where ***s*** is any complex number other than 1.   

<img src="/home/jw/books/tholonia/Images/rzf-form.png" style="width:80%" />



Related sidenote, using just prime numbers you can also determine &pi;:    $$\displaystyle 1-\frac{1}{3} +\frac{1}{5} \ -\frac{1}{7} +\frac{1}{9} -\frac{1}{11} +...=\frac{\pi }{4}$$

One of the useful feature of the RZF is that is can can turn a *divergent* series of numbers (number that when you add then together approach infinity) and turn it into a *convergent* series (when sum approached a specific value, like $-\frac{1}{12}$ or $\frac{\pi ^{2}}{6}$). It can do this does because the hypothesis uses the concept of *analytic continuation* and *complex numbers*. You can play with this function using an online Riemann Zeta Function Calculator. [^186]

The RZF is based on the *Riemann hypothesis*, which also states that  ζ(*s*)=0 only when **s** is a negative even integer or a complex number with real part of $\frac{1}{2}$. This hypothesis is really quite profound in the way it relates to the distribution of prime numbers. That won't be explained here, but it is quite understandable when properly explained.  There are a couple of excellent videos on the subject at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD0NjbwqlYw and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6c6uIyieoo.  

This 160 years old hypothesis has yet to be proven, however, and because it is considered by many mathematicians to the  most important unsolved problem in pure mathematics, the Clay Mathematics Institute has a reward of US$1 million to anyone who could solve it. *(Update. September 24, 2018.  Michael Atiyah , the 89 year old mathematician emeritus at The University of Edinburgh, claims he has proved this, but many experts doubt its validity)*

Understanding how the RZF works would (probably) help explain the how and why patterns of prime numbers appear organically in any data-set of naturally occurring samples, such as the charts above.

What value would we get if we applied the RZF to the series of square roots of natural numbers?  Some really smart person did exactly this [^187], and the answer is… Viola!

# $\sqrt{2\pi }$

The inverse $\boldsymbol{\sqrt{2\pi }}$ is $\boldsymbol{\sqrt{\frac{\pi }{2}}}$.  This is interesting because now we have formulas that fit into the pattern position of Ohms' Law.  Out of curiosity I applied Ohm's Law to these numbers.  For the sake of clarity, I assigned some of the formulas to variables, otherwise it's too bothersome to read (or compose).  In the table below I show Ohm's Law, some example data demonstrating the math of Ohm's Law, and then the application to$\boldsymbol{\sqrt{\frac{\pi }{2}}}$  and $\boldsymbol{\sqrt{2\pi }}$.  Those two values alone were enough to fill in all the missing values.  In the third column of the table I show the actual numbers, and to the right, the formulas.



<img src="/home/jw/books/tholonia/Images/ohmslaw-pi.png" style="width:100%" />

Some of the point of interest are:

- Every variable except for the number 2 is a function of pi.

- **&gamma;**  is the result of RZF of the square-roots of all natural numbers > 1, which is the sequence of values that define a Fresnel lens and our distance-delta. that sequence of natural numbers is created by ζ(1). The $\gamma $ pattern position is that of *volts*, or *the amount of potential that exists between two poles*.

- **&beta;** is the inverse of $\gamma$ and occupies the pattern position of Amps or Current (I).

   

- **2** is in the same pattern position as *resistance* and *mass*. 2 is the only natural number, and is also the first prime number, and by some thinking, the first natural number as 1 can be considered not a "number" in the normal sense of the word.  In the RZF, it is $\boldsymbol{\frac{1}{2}}$, the inverse of 2, that marks the center of the symmetry for all numbers, natural and complex. This means that the $\boldsymbol{\frac{1}{2}}$ point, not the 0 point, is the pivotal point that mirrors all the values on one side the $\frac{1}{2}$ and which are reflected on the equal but opposite side of $\boldsymbol{\frac{1}{2}}$.  This is also apparent when we see that $\boldsymbol{ζ(0) = \frac{1}{2}}$. 

- **&pi;** is in the same pattern position as *Power* (P) and *Energy* (E). This especially makes sense when we see that &pi; equals $\boldsymbol{\beta\gamma}$ (or $\sqrt{\pi /2\ }\sqrt{\pi 2}$ )

  

From a Tholonic perspective, 2&pi; represents a complete tholon.  What is interesting is if we use Ohm's Law and replace &pi; with 2&pi;, and $\alpha$ with $\boldsymbol{\frac{\pi ^{2}}{6}}$ (which is the result of &zeta;(2), then $\beta$ = $\sqrt{3.81971863420549}$ . Why is that interesting?  Because, 3.81971863420549 is especially relevant to moving bodies, like the Sun and the Moon. I have no idea if the following are in any way related to the Sun-Moon dataset, but this number is:

- Neutron g-factor, "which is is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes the magnetic moment and angular momentum of an atom, a particle or nucleus"
- The revolutions per day in one radian/hour (1 radian/hour = 3.819718634205 revolution/day).  You may have never heard of these units of measurement, but they are used in both subatomic and planetary sciences.  One full turn is 2π radians. A Hour Angle is 1/24^th^ of a full turn, or &pi;/12 radians.   Like the neutron g-factor, it is a unit that measure angular velocity and rotational frequency.

We also see that $\gamma$ equals $\sqrt{10.3354255600999}$, and that it interesting because:

- This one is my favorite!  A pyramid with a base side length and height of  &pi;  will have a volume of &pi;^3^/3, which equals 10.3354255600999.

## Node Frame

In the "node-frame" graph above where the nodes are highlighted with red and green dots, there is also a graph to the left of that pattern that shows the spiral nature of the dots.  It is a spiral that increases in frequency as it descends. While it nicely describes the placement of the nodes as they descend, it also happens to describes the trajectory of a charged particle in an electric field.  I know this because I used the algorithm that simulated charged particles in an electric field to build the spiral and then simply tweaked the values for mass and the z-axis of the magnetic field vector.  This is not to say anything other that these two fundamental patterns share similar properties.





## Spirals

The pattern we are seeing created by the reduced prime values looks exactly like a diffraction pattern, and the associated distances look like like a diffraction lens. It is not immediately clear how these patterns came into being.  In the real world, to create a diffraction pattern we need some light and some matter and just let physics to its thing.  It is the recording of these diffraction patterns that makes holograms act like holograms.  Holograms are 'nothing more' that complex diffraction patterns.  Is it just a coincidence that the mathematics that describes 3-dimensional projections also describes our 3-dimensional reality? Is it possible that the planets, suns, and the Universe in general is the result of the focusing of energy via a multidimensional lens?  Are holograms micro-metaphors for reality? Until I am shown why this is not the case, that is an idea that will remain on the 'table,' at least for me.

While the manner in which prime numbers create a diffraction pattern may be a mystery (to me), how diffraction patterns are created are not. Properly described, it would require a lot of math which we won't get in to there, but a quick search on "What is the Cornu's spiral method for diffraction pattern?" will reveal all to the more curious.  In short, because we know that the intensity of light at any point is always proportional to two values known as the *Fresnel integrals*  $\begin{cases} x( t) =\int ^{t}_{0}\cos\left( u^{2}\right) du & \\ y( t) =\int ^{t}_{0}\sin\left( u^{2}\right) du &  \end{cases}$, we can plot the intensity of each point along the diffraction pattern on a 2-Dimensional plot. When we do this this, we end up with an amazing figure called the *Cornu Spiral*, shown below as "2D Cornu Spiral (Fresnel).

<img src="/home/jw/books/tholonia/Images/cornu.png" style="width:100%" />





Can we say…

>  The Cornu Spiral describes the diffraction pattern formed by the Zipf distribution of prime numbers (in accordance to the RZF).

Another interesting thing about the Cornu Spiral is that it also describes the path of the sun over the course of the year (from Earth's perspective)[^185], which is pretty poetic. The Cornu spiral describes not only how light and matter interact in the nanometer scale, but also on the planetary scale if we consider the Sun as light and the Earth as matter.

Not surprisingly, the Riemann Zeta Function also creates not just one Cornu Spiral, but an entire series of spirals, as shown in "Cornu Spiral (RZF), that emerge from nothing to the final spiral.   

The *x* and the *y* values are the result of a function based on a value, as in *x(t)*=blah, *y(t)*=blahblah (see *Fresnel Integrals* above), there can be a third dimension based on *t*. When this new *z* dimension is proportional to the x and y dimensions, a cone is created on the z-axis, which, I suspect, could also explain the diminishing angles of the node-frame cycles.  





## Flights of Fancy

In one way, it is like the prime numbers are similar to photons in that it is the individual photons that create the diffraction pattern just like the individual primes also create the diffraction pattern.  Both of these 'particles' (photons and prime numbers) are presumably following some of the same rules in some fashion.  Given my lack of training in this area, I can only wonder if the wave/particle properties of photons also apply (contextually) to prime numbers (p.s. there is such a thing as Feynman Sunshine Numbers, which relates prime number and photons).

But what about the node-frame, which seems to be described by the Lorentz Force?  How does that fit into this? Quite nicely, in fact, as the Lorentz Force is the vanity name (scientists do this a lot) for electromagnetism, one of the four fundamental forces that holds all reality together (the other three being gravity, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force). It refers to electromagnetic fields that have the power to accelerate (or otherwise exert an electric or magnetic force upon) a charged particle (like an electron). It is the force that moves electrons.  

Is it possible to map the Lorentz Force to the cone of the Cornu Spiral? They share some of the same properties, in that they increase in frequency as they approach their origin (0 for RZF, and 0 for wavelength (or frequency of &infin;) for Lorentz Force)

It seems that the Cornu Spiral in integral to some pretty fundamental realities, from prime numbers and power laws to planetary movement and electromagnetism.  

## Is true randomness only a concept?

It is possible that true randomness may be theoretically impossible to achieve. Perhaps randomness is like infinity; usable as a concept but non-existent in actual reality in that it can only be approached, never achieved.  Even radioactive decay, which is considered the gold-standard for randomness, is not completely random, because if you sample it enough you will begin to see a pattern that represents the beta decay made possible the the nuclear weak force which is conserving energy thanks to entropy. 

All of that is best left to the physicists and mathematicians, but from the Tholonic perspective, there was/is only one truly random event, and that would be the spontaneous creation of the original N-State, suggesting that the Big Bang was a truly random event within the context and scope of our reality.  Everything after that has some order to it, even if we can't see it, or even if it is only implicit.

[https://www.muse.jhu.edu/article/600628](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/600628).  Charles Ross, the creator, describes: "1972. I had placed this simple lens set-up on the roof so the sun would burn a path across a wooden plank as the day progressed. The idea was to collect a portrait of the weather each day. As the work progressed, I noticed that the burn's curvature was changing with the seasons. We took photos of the burns and placed them end to end following their curvature to see what a year's worth looked like. The sum of days generated a double spiral figure. At first, it did not make any sense-this primitive lens set-up was producing a complex spiral shape. A few of the astronomers I showed it to said, "Well, it must be coming from somewhere, but we have no idea what it is." Most of the scientists insisted that there had to be some anomaly in the set-up and that the shape had nothing to do with astronomy -just some weirdness in the lens. In reality, it made no difference at all if the lens faced one way or the other as long as it faced generally toward south. The elements of the spiral are in sunlight itself; it was an archetypal image falling from the sky. I finally contacted Kenneth Franklin at the Hayden Planetarium. He directed me to the Naval Observatory, where LeRoy Doggett, an astronomer with the Nautical Almanac office…."  Authors note: This Sun Spiral was pieces together manually from many separate samples, and should not be seen as an accurate representation of the suns paths, but only an approximation.

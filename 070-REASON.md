REASON
======

###### The ability to understand something is limited by our ability to perceive something. As our perception changes, so does our understanding change, and with that, the reasoning we apply.

We arrived at these laws through reason, and we humans are rather proud of that claim as we like to believe we invented reason, but we didn't. We did discover it, however, so at least we can take credit for being doggedly curious.

*Reason* is what we call our ability to recognize the natural processes that arise from the patterns of creation and is the product of intellectual survival, a skill we evolved to give us fang-less, claw-less, slow, small and tasty humans a fighting chance in the Darwinian battlefield.

To be fair, there has been a long-standing debate over whether mathematics, and by association, reason, was invented or discovered. One of the more solid debates is presented by leading astrophysicist Mario Livio in his article “Why Math
Works”<sup>[16](#ref_016)</sup>

In that article, he refers to those who believe math was discovered as Platonists, due to the fact that Platonic archetypes include math archetypes, as math is a form of an idea. Livio gets into the idea that math is subject to the same evolutionary forces as species in that math that does not work quickly dies, never again to propagate itself into the mathematical 'gene pool.'

The same is true for any idea or theory. Ideas such as the phlogiston theory of fire and Descartes theory of the motion of planets are examples of conceptual offspring that were quickly dispatched by the deadly and merciless hand of proof. It's a bit different on the social level, where we see failed political and economic ideologies that, although their ruin is inevitable from the start, they continue to pop up, for, in the realms of ideology, proof is often eclipsed by belief, hope, power and mass hysteria.

A sounder argument that reason was discovered is that the systems we have created with our reasoning abilities, from plumbing to artificial intelligence (AI), have come to the same conclusion as nature when faced with similar challenges, such as water distribution, blood cell design, language, etc. In the case of AI, armed with our rules of reason, it has significantly out-designed human solutions many times. These improved solutions were derived by observing the situation and applying the laws of reason that we instructed the AI system with, laws that we ourselves derived from observing our reality. The fact that AI is coming up with solutions that not only exceed ours but are more in harmony with nature is pretty good evidence that the laws of reason are objectively verifiable and existed before humans arrived on the scene.

In any case, both sides can agree, for the most part, that math is the language man invented to describe the existing laws he discovered and likewise, reasoning is the process man invented to describe the unfolding order of existence that he was capable of perceiving. This is a sufficiently satisfactory answer with regard to math and reason, but reasoning, in general, has a lot more gray area than mathematics.

The Limits of Reason
--------------------

Reason has been pretty effective in describing our reality, but it has its limits, at least in the way we use it today.

For example, the traditional Law of Thought<sup>[17](#ref_017)</sup> goes something like:

-   **The Law of Non-Contradiction states:**

> “Nothing can both exist and not exist at the same time and in the same respect, or no statement is both true and false.”

-   **The Law of Excluded Middle states:**

> “Something either exists or does not exist, or every statement is either true or false.”

-   **The Law of Identity states:**

> “Everything is the same as itself, or a statement cannot remain the same and change its truth value.”

These laws are much like math, in fact, they have their own algebraic notation: ∼(p·∼p), F(x)⊃F(x)**,** (∀x) (x=x), respectively.

It seems reasonable to assert that these laws existed before we came up with a way to define them. We certainly did not invent the fact that something cannot “be” and “not be” at the same time. We discovered that this is a property of our reality, or rather, in the way we perceive our reality. If we broaden our perceptions to include the reality that something *can be* and *cannot be* at the same time, then our reasoning must adapt.

A hardcore Aristotelian materialist might say “The law of non-contradiction specifically forbids something to be in a state of existence and non-existence. The universe has a transcendent self-consistent order, and that order cannot be violated. Its primary manifestation is thus: it exists, and it cannot be otherwise”, while a Platonist might say something can exist as an archetype but not as a material instance. A scientist might suggest that something can exist implicitly, but not explicitly, like the ink drop, and a Hindu guru might mess everything up by saying “The One is both *Sat* (existing) and *Asat* (non-existing).”

It would appear that the laws of reason depend on the scope of one's perspective and what one accepts as axiomatic or true, transcendental or otherwise. How, then, can these laws be preexisting if they contradict each other? This is sort of like the fable of the blind men and the elephant, where one blind man holding the elephant's tail describes it as a snake, and the other, holding the foot, describes it as a tree, or perhaps like the brilliant sculptures of Mathew Robert Ortis, such as “Revolution Giraffes”, which looks like a giraffe from one angle, but an elephant from another.

<center><img src="media/016-eleph-giraf.png" style="width:90%" /></center>
The blind men and the viewers of the sculpture are all perceiving a preexisting form that is undebatably “true”, but they can't seem to agree on what it is.

Each of these fine folks can easily define and defend their worldview. They are all able to recognize the reality they have accepted as true, supported by the reasoning of that truth.

### Labels and Names

In all cases, before one can proclaim some thing's existence, that thing has to be named and something about it must be known, or at least presumed. We can't say something exists if we have no idea what it is we are making that claim about. We can see this readily in the way languages form ideas and labels which become the foundation of cultural understanding.

I can say my dog exists because I know *my* dog, I know *of* dogs, and everyone I know also knows of dogs. But can I say *phlimquitz* exist, and when you ask me what a *phlimquitz* is, I say “I have no idea”? That would be quite unreasonable, but if I said *phlimquitz* explains the 99.97% correlation between “U.S. Spending on science, space and technology vs. Suicide by hanging, strangulation, and suffocation”, then I am claiming to understand something heretofore unknown and can go about defining and testing the *Phlimquitz Hypothesis*.

#### **Claim 18:** We name things according to our observations, and once named, they become conceptual realities. 

Here is that correlation, just for fun:<sup>[18](#ref_018)</sup>

<center><img src="media/017-suicide.jpg" style="width:90%" alt="U.S. Spending on science, space and technology vs Suicide by hanging, strangulation and suffocation" /></center>
This process of understanding is similar to recognizing a pattern in a series of random dots. In the image below I can definitely see a person dancing, and I can easily prove it by connecting the dots. I am not wrong, but neither is the person who sees an egg sandwich. However, any predictions either of us makes on where the next dot will land or in determining the properties attributes of the dots, based on the understanding of our perceptions, will most likely fail. Through trial and error, testing, and proofs, we will finally discover that these dots represent no specific pattern. Once we recognize the concept of randomness, we can name, define it, and study it.

<center><img src="media/018-star-dancer.png" style="width:90%" alt="dots.png" /></center>
Humans began grasping this concept of randomness about 3,000 years ago, but named it things like “fate”, “chance”, and “destiny”, and, being unpredictable, was usually associated with some sort of supernatural justice or punishment. It wasn't until the 16<sup>th</sup> century that Italian mathematicians began to formalize the concept of what we call randomness, so it's still quite a young concept.

#### **Claim 19:** Our ability to reason comes from our ability to see patterns, and our ability to see patterns comes from our ability to reason. 

God(s), angels, spirits, the Djinn, magic, luck, coincidence, mystical forces, kundalini, chi, mana,
out-of-body-experiences<sup>[19](#ref_019)</sup>, etc., are all concepts that many people have a clear understanding of, and as such, they are able to say it exists because they cannot only recognize it but can produce reams of information about it. To be clear, this is not meant to suggest these observations are, or are not, as valid as any other. Any system's validity depends solely on the contextual effectiveness of the reasoning behind it and the ability of that reasoning to produce verifiably accurate statements about it.

It would be hubris to write-off alternative views of reality given every culture in the world has a concept of some sort of paranormal, metaphysical energy. Some of these cultures have extremely demanding training and lengthy education to tap into it. Even our western icons, such as Paracelsus, Hippocrates, Carl Jung, Erwin Schrodinger, and Plato have referred to it.

For better or worse, it seems that pretty much anything can be a Truth as long as people can recognize it and support it with whatever sort of reasoning they happen to be using. For our purposes, we are only concerned with reasoning that is based on the laws of nature, as they are perceived. We need only look at history, and some places on the planet, to see the many versions of truth that have evolved, and how dramatically they differ from each other.

### The Truth about Truth 

This raises the Big Question…What is truth?

This is a question we can never answer absolutely. We can't speak about what the ultimate truth is because there is no fool-proof way, no absolute proof, that any one way of looking at something is the “right” way. All we can speak about is what is the most reasonable understanding given the context of our reality and our perceptions of it. What, then, is the arbiter of proof as to whether something is “reasonably true” or not, given our current understanding of reality?

One arbiter is, of course, power. When Friedrich Nietzsche said “There is no truth, only power”, he was half right. Truth is a journey of discovery, while power is a battle for who gets to navigate that journey.

### Sustainability

Outside of that battlefield of culture and politics, we do have at least one gauge, and that is the measure of sustainability. This sustainability may be the best test as to the validity of something because its explicit existence alone is proof it exists in accordance with the rules of reality.

Achieving sustainability is more likely in a balanced environment as that is the optimum state for energy to create patterns from which order will emerge from chaos. Energy always seeks to achieve a balance; therefore, sustainability is the measure of the degree that order and balance can be maintained. Unsustainability will result in chaos.

This raises an interesting question: if (high-entropy) chaos is the ultimate state of the Universe, then it must also be the most sustainable as it will never change once arrived at. Oddly, this appears to be true.

All the movement of energy that exists at every level of reality is the result of energy seeking the path of least resistance as it attempts to balance itself out. We see examples of this everywhere, such as when we add hydrochloric acid with sodium hydroxide. After an extremely violent readjustment phase that releases a ton of energy (heat), it settles down to the very stable, lower energy-demanding products of water and table salt.

The Universe, starting with the extremely violent Big Bang and ending (according to popular theory) in a bunch of inert matter, the cosmic equivalent of water and table salt, is essentially the readjustment phase of different states of imbalance coming to terms with one another. Reality is the reaction of this adjustment, and like the chemical reaction just mentioned, will ultimately balance out and just sit there, doing nothing.

The ultimate destination of sustainability, on the cosmic scale, is death. On our level of existence, sustainability means keeping the various part of the “balancing machine” of nature working properly. In both cases sustainability means balance, but with two very different results of short-term, or *temporal* balance and long-term, or *supernal* balance. For our purposes, the sustainability we are referring to is the temporal kind, unless otherwise noted.

#### **Claim 20:** Sustainability is a gauge of existence, and therefore life itself, at every level of reality. 

Pions exist for about 26 nanoseconds, while the most massive black hole known, about 66 billion times larger than our sun, would require 6x10<sup>99</sup> years to evaporate. Does this mean that black holes are more ‘valid', more ‘true' than pions? No, because the pion's existence, short as it is, is necessary, otherwise it would never have existed in the first place, but the validity of a pion, essentially the truth of its explicit existence, is only valid for 26 nanoseconds while the validity of a black hole is forever (as 6x10<sup>99</sup> years is actually longer than the life span of the Universe). By this logic, we can say that both pions and black hole are equally true and valid, but one ‘true' forever.

#### **Claim 21:** Something exists because its expression of energy patterns adheres to an order that must be maintained to continue existing. 

### Tree of Sustainability

Let's take a look at a more integrated example; that of a single cell, the building block of life. This is high-school biology, but let's go over it again.

Each of these processes has proven itself to be more ‘true' by being sustainable above all other possible processes

-   Inside the cell are two meters of tightly wound strands of four very specific molecules, held together by sugar phosphates, which make up the DNA of that cell. These are C<sup>5</sup>H<sup>5</sup>N<sup>5</sup> (adenine), C<sup>5</sup>H<sup>5</sup>N<sup>5</sup>O (guanine), C<sup>4</sup>H<sup>5</sup>N<sup>3</sup>O (cytosine) and C<sup>5</sup>H<sup>6</sup>N<sup>2</sup>O<sup>2</sup> (thymine). They are arranged in a very specific order which describes the instructions necessary to build every protein in an organism.

-   In a process known as transcription, a molecular machine first unwinds a section of the DNA helix to expose the genetic instructions needed to assemble a specific protein molecule.

-   Another machine then copies these instructions to form a molecule known as messenger RNA.

-   When transcription is complete the RNA strand carries the genetic information through the nuclear pore complex, the gatekeeper for traffic in and out of the cell nucleus.

-   The messenger RNA strand is directed to a two-part molecular factory called a ribosome.

-   After attaching itself securely the process of translation begins.

-   Inside the ribosome, a molecular assembly line builds a specifically sequenced chain of amino acids.

-   These amino acids are transported from other parts of the cell.

-   They are linked into chains often hundreds of units long. Their sequential arrangement determines the type of protein manufactured.

-   When the chain is finished it is moved from the ribosome to a barrel-shaped machine.

-   It is then folded into the precise shape critical to its function.

-   After the train is folded into a protein it is then released and shepherded by another molecular machine to the exact location where it is needed.

These processes, and their order, are so specific, so complex, so difficult to explain with current evolutionary models, that Dean Kenyon, a Professor Emeritus of Biology at San Francisco State University who actually taught Evolutionary Theory, switched teams in 1979 and went on to be a key member in the “Intelligent Design” movement.

The important point here is that if any one thing in the list of processes listed above changes, if one atom in the C<sup>5</sup>H<sup>5</sup>N<sup>5</sup> molecule was different, or the ‘gatekeeper' made a bad call or a thousand other possibilities, the cell would either die or mutate. It would become unsustainable, or it would make the larger organism unsustainable. This is actually what cancer is, the malformed reproduction of cells that reduce organisms sustainability. Interestingly, the cancer cell itself can be quite sustainable as an independent cell and only becomes a problem as a community of cells.

For a cell to be sustainable, to continue existing, only one process, made up of numerous detailed steps, all of which must function properly, will result in successful functioning and reproduction. More importantly, we can't explain why any one particular option in any step, out of the countless theoretical options available at each step, is the one step that the process ‘knows' to select.

To put this in even clearer perspective, using twenty amino acids to create a very small protein (150 amino acids), there are 10<sup>77</sup> possible combinations. In the world of biology, this exponential growth of possibilities is actually called *combinatorial inflation*. Remember that term, as we'll come back to it later on. How many of these 10<sup>77</sup> possibilities can produce a viable protein? Very few, and of those few only one will work, that being the one that works with the others it must integrate with. It's not quite as bad as the likelihood of a million monkeys banging on a million typewriters to eventually produce the entire works of Shakespeare, but considering it would take 2,737,850 million-billion-billion-billion monkey-years to write the line from Hamlet “RUMOUR. Open your ears”<sup>[20](#ref_020)</sup>, how likely is the chance that this 1:10<sup>77</sup> process could happen successfully 10<sup>40</sup> times, which is the number of organisms that have ever existed in the history of the planet? For life to evolve (in the Darwinian sense) as it has over the past 4.5 billion years, this 1:10<sup>77</sup> process would need to happen 7x10<sup>99</sup> times per second, which equates to every living thing on planet today performing this process 7x10<sup>74</sup> times per second! As your own body only has 34 trillion cells, each one would have to perform this process 3x10<sup>56</sup> times per second, and unless the vast majority all hit the jackpot of creating the *same* viable life form, you would just be a pile of lifeless bio-goo at the moment of conception. Admittedly, these numbers may be inaccurate due to their speculative nature, but the general idea that evolution is a genetic crapshoot is far more inaccurate.

What we call a cell is a collective of components that not only all work together with miraculous precision, but which seems to have an intelligence of its own that understands the requirements of how each component must operate with each other component in order to preserve and maintain its sustainability, its existence. Likewise, the components themselves, like the barrel-shaped machine and the transcriptors, are also made of components that have the same intentions and decision-making abilities.

Evolutionists will say that all the other options, at one time in our past, were tried, and failed, leaving only the process that worked. Intelligent Designers will say that this was “biochemical predeterminism”, i.e. that the process was preprogrammed, somehow. Both of these answers are just kicking the can down the road, that ‘can' being the question of where and how this historical record of what worked and what didn't work is stored along with the knowledge of a very strict set of rules and conditions that informs the process, along with and how this data is it accessed.

Let's take a look at a couple of macro examples on the social human scale and examine the serious questions it raises about the way we understand it.

### Ayahuasca

One of the more fascinating details about *ayahuasca*, a ritual psychoactive drink from the Amazon, is how it is made and how it was discovered in the first place. The main active ingredient of ayahuasca is N, N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT). DMT is a powerful hallucinogenic drug that exists in plants (and the human brain) yet has no effect on humans when taken orally because of the enzyme *monoamine oxidase* (MAO) in our blood that prevents it from passing the blood/brain barrier, which is a semipermeable membrane that separates the blood from the cerebrospinal fluid and which blocks many cells, particles, and large molecules, from entering the brain. This is a very good thing, as there is a lot of stuff floating around in our blood that can really mess with the brain.

In order for the DMT to get to the brain, it has to pass through the blood/brain barrier, and for that to happen there must be something that stops the MAOs from doing its job. That thing is called a *MAO Inhibitor* (MAOI). MAOIs are commonly used in pharmaceuticals to help with ailments such as depression and Parkinson's disease (which, according to Stanford University, are the same two things that tango dancing also helps).

Modern science has known about both of these drugs for a little over 100 years. Indigenous Amazonian shamans have known about them for about 5,000 years. Somehow, in a manner beyond the ability of modern Western man to comprehend, these shamans managed to discover that the bark of one particular vine, from over 40,000 species of plants, contained a lot of DMT. They also, somehow, knew that an MAOI was needed, which they found in another of those 40,000 species. Traditional anthropologists would have you believe they discovered this by trial and error, but with just a little thought, it is clear how ridiculous that theory is.

Of the 1,600,000,000 possible pairing combinations of Amazonian plants, only one produces ayahuasca, and even then, only when a certain part of the plants are used. In addition, these 1,600,000,000 possibilities do not consider the variables of proportion or the specifics of preparation. For that many trial-and-error tests, even if every man, woman, and child in all of South America partook in the finding, preparing, and experimenting, it would take over 2,000 years, which then raises the question of record-keeping as to what was already tested. The fact that modern science expects any semi-intelligent person to believe its trial-and-error theory is laughable, but also pretty frightening that so many scientists *do* believe this.

### Curare

For other substances, such as the paralyzing poison *curare* used by South American indigenous people for hunting, the chances are astronomically greater.

Curare is a poison that paralyzes an animal, but soon after being paralyzed the poison is metabolized by the animal, rendering it harmless. That is obviously a pretty essential requirement, as you can't be eating the same poison you used to catch the animal. Just imagining that the locals knew of this requirement and then set out to find such a drug somewhere in the Amazon is difficult for modern anthropologists to accept.

Beyond that, there are 172 different types of this one-in-40000 species in the jungle, and only one of them works, but the real kicker is that the fumes one is exposed to while preparing the curare are fatal! How does modern science imagine this was achieved?

> *Wanadi:* “Trumak! Mojie just died testing that new batch of curare!”
>
> *Trumak:* “Bummer. And he was so close! Go and try that again, with the same batch…and remember to keep smelling it. That's how you know it's done.”
>
> Wanadi: “OK!”

On the other hand, if one were to ask a shaman how these things were discovered, he would simply say, “The plants told us.” Other cultures who have similar stories might say their ancestors told them, or the crickets, or the bones of a sacred animal, or the cracks in the shell of a tortoise after it has been heated and then dropped into cold water and then compared to the position of the stars, as was the case with the origins of the Chinese I-Ching.

For Western man, talking to plants, insects or bones is usually followed by pharmaceuticals prescribed by a psychiatrist. For just about every other indigenous culture, including the indigenous culture that Western civilization grew from, they had some way to tap into this organic database of knowledge.

Just as a cellular transcriptor has the intelligence necessary to manage its sustainability, which is then managed by the intelligence of a cell, and up the chain this continues all the way to a human being (which is just a stop along the journey, as we humans are part of a yet larger system), it is not unreasonable to presume there is an intelligence that manages *its* components of humans.

Our ancestors called this intelligence ‘the voice of the gods' and about 5,000 years ago we started to create the idea of an all-in-one-version of the gods. This was a very practical idea and worked very well given the context and scope of our ancestor's world view. It gave one name to all things unknown and satisfied their need for a sense of truth and order. Once named it was left to humans to try and describe that truth and order.

The Human Brain and Reason
--------------------------

The American Psychologist Julian Jaynes, in his very popular book “*The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind”* (1976) presents his theory of the evolution of the human brain, wherein he claims that our ancestors heard voices in their heads instructing them what they needed to do and needed to know, and these voices of unknown origin were attributed to the “gods”, and therefore became the voice of Truth.

> <img src="media/019-bicameral-brain.jpg" style="float:right;width:35%" />“Who then were these gods that pushed men about like robots and sang epics through their lips? They were voices whose speech and directions could be as distinctly heard by the Iliadic heroes as voices are heard by certain epileptic and schizophrenic patients, or just as Joan of Arc heard her voices. The gods were organizations of the central nervous system and can be regarded as personae in the sense of poignant consistencies through time, amalgams of parental or admonitory images. The god is a part of the man, and quite consistent with this conception is the fact that the gods never step outside of natural laws.”<sup>[21](#ref_021)</sup>

Jaynes claims that a bit before 1000 BC (just around the time of the Tower of Babel by Sumerian accounts) the human consciousness was not yet ‘meta-conscious', meaning humans were not aware of their awareness. The bicameral part of Jaynes theory suggests that there were two parts of the brain, the one that managed mundane jobs, habits, rote tasks, etc. (the self), and another part which, when faced with confusing and/or difficult challenges, took over (the voice of god).

> \[For bicameral humans\], volition came as a voice that was in the nature of a neurological command, in which the command and the action were not separated, in which to hear was to obey.
>
> Sidenote: What we call the “ego” today evolved out of that really boring and mundane “self” part of the brain, so it's probably best not to use it for anything other than mundane tasks.

According to Jaynes, the transition from bicameralism to consciousness (linguistic meta-cognition) occurred over the period from 1800 BC to 800 BC. We know this time as the time from when Hammurabi ruled Babylonia, where he wrote down one of the first set of laws known to humanity dealing with challenging and confusing issues such as contracts, wages, liability, inheritance, divorce, paternity, and reproductive behavior, to name a few, to the founding of Rome. This metamorphosis of consciousness ushered in the golden age of empires and cultures that laid the foundation of Western Civilization in areas of art, literature, theatre, government, philosophy, mathematics, and even sports. (*I am singling out Western culture simply because that is the culture I best understand and which has the most information available, and not because I do not think other cultures have not developed along their own lines under similar conditions.)*

From the days of Rome and the ancient Greek philosophers to today our bicameralism has further diminished, which can account for the decreasing incidents of people hearing the gods speak to them. This may have been a good thing, but the problem that arose as a result of the gods abandoning us, forcing us to apply reason to challenging problems when our pleas for guidance were ignored, is that our newly developed tools of reason rejected any ideas that we could not understand, which were many given we were still new at the whole reasoning thing during some very desperate times. Our fledgling ability to consciously make sense of things seemed to be working, so it naturally dominated our world view, even if we were, and are, still figuring out how it works.

Still, as Jaynes so eloquently puts it:

> The mind is still haunted with its old unconscious ways; it broods on lost authorities; and the yearning, the deep and hollowing yearning for divine volition and service is with us still.

Hence, religion.

Anything and everything that did not fit into the highly constrained and “reasonable” worldview was pushed farther and farther outside the box of mainstream thought until we arrived at where we are today. In one way this ‘inquisition-by-reason', which served to purge heretical thoughts from the dogma of the cult of reason, was, and is, quite necessary and useful, because in the reformation that has begun, those ancient ideas that can withstand the tests of our deeper understanding of reason will be resurrected in a new form with modern understanding.

The memories of the cell, the voices in our ancestor's heads, the wisdom of the plants as heard by the shamans, and countless other instances of “divine” or “mystical” knowledge, all beg the same questions: Where does this information come from? Where is it stored? How does one access it?

Perhaps *reason* has evolved to the point where we may be able to answer these questions, reasonably.

The Path of Reason
------------------

The rules and conditions of reality that we have discovered have followed a perfectly reasonable path long before man was able to claim them as such. Sometimes it takes a while to find them, but eventually, we do, so far.

<img src="media/020-planet-logs.gif" style="float:left;width:40%" />For thousands of years, Man looked at the path of the stars and came up with various stories about why they were where they were. It wasn't until Kepler discovered the pattern by plotting the paths on a logarithmic chart that the reasoning became clear. This became Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion that states *“the square of the planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of its distance from the sun.”*

In the same manner, we discovered DNA is a helix because of hydrogen bonds, etc., so we can say “Here is a pattern and the rules that created it.”

This is not to say everything that the gatekeepers of the Church of Reason consider “unreasonable”, such as myths, magic, aliens, hyper-dimensional beings, and numerous other paranormal, metaphysical areas are, indeed, “unreasonable.” On the contrary, it's quite unreasonable to presume they have no reasoning behind them as many of these ideas perfectly conform to natural law, albeit within a scope that extends outside our common boundaries. Historical examples of once unreasonable ideas include electricity, flight, wireless communications, space travel, nuclear energy and pretty much the majority of the reality of modern life. These things were considered nothing less than magic and science fiction until we were able to recognize it and discover the rules of how they worked. Once we discovered Bernoulli's law<sup>[22](#ref_022)</sup> works in harmony with the law of gravity we mastered the magic art of flying.

#### **Claim 22:** Reason is the codification of the rules of a reality as we have come to know it. 

### The benevolence of self-preservation

If our reasoning is based on the world we observe, then this implies that everything in nature, everything in the universe, must, therefore, be reasonable, but sometimes the reasoning we have derived from our observations is inaccurate or lacking.

#### **Claim 23:** The rules of reason are predetermined based on the rules of our reality that we have recognized, and these rules require that any “reason” that exists must abide by them. 

Take, for example, our reasoning behind the evolutionary drive for self-preservation. We assume it is a somewhat selfish, even if necessary, biological drive passed down through our genes in order to increase the genes chances of reproducing itself. This makes sense if we see the world as a bunch of individual entities competing for dominance.

Another way to see self-preservation is from the perspective of the larger organism that is composed of many contributing organisms.

Take the example of a collective, such as a tribe. If the collective is destroyed, then all its members also suffer from that loss. The collective, then, has a strong responsibility to the members. On the other hand, if the members were to become damaged in some way, the collective suffers as well. So, the collective will both attempt to preserve itself for the sake of its members and preserve the members for the sake of itself. We don't think of a collective as an organism, but all organisms are collectives, therefore collectives *can* be organisms. Now apply this reasoning to an animal. The animal will attempt to preserve itself for the sake of its members (organs, limbs, cells, etc.), and preserve its members for the sake of itself.

From the perspective of the parent organism, such as the collective, it is worth losing a member if that means it will benefit the collective and/or the ability of the collective to preserve its members.

One example of this are the cardiac muscle cells that have the self-preservation ability to duck, dart, and dodge foreign substances, but these actions may harm the cells to the point where they can cause a fatal heart attack, all in an attempt to preserve themselves, even though they are killing their parent organism.

Some theorize that they do this because there is a greater chance of the heart surviving if the cells can avoid damage and hold out for the possibility of the heart being resuscitated. A far more reasonable explanation is that the component elements of a person (the cells, in this case) are compelled to preserve *their* component elements (nucleus, chromatins, cytoplasm, organelles, etc.). Killing the parent organism is not its concern, nor within the scope of its influence as. Preservation of the members is the concern of the parent organism, who has obviously failed in its duty to protect its components in the example given. The sacrificed parent organism of *person*, which would be the collective (tribe, community, country, etc.) will only lose one (improperly functioning) member.

In this particular example of cardiac cells, their self-preservation can be fatal to the collective, but in most cases losing a few cells is not fatal to the collective, still, and by the same token, the *uber* organism that humans are a part of (family, society, government, etc.) only forfeits one human. This is happening in our own bodies 60 billion times a day, as that is how many of our own cells dies, and are created, every day.

#### **Claim 23A**: The most efficient model for a collective is individual self-preservation.

Seeing self-preservation more as a protecting-the-family-of-component-parts makes much more sense *if* we also see that every organism in the hierarchy of life, from cells to cities, as an individual entity,

Just as an entity will endanger its collective in an attempt to preserve its members, a collective will sacrifice a member for the betterment of the whole.

This perspective also explains how a person is able to sacrifice itself for the sake of another, even though they have no genetic connection to the other person, ruling out genetic preference as is the case when a parent sacrifices themselves for their child. This would also suggest that our most basic drive is not the survival of the self, but the survival of something more important than the self. We see this in cases of love, honor, country, god, etc.

You might be thinking that is a trait unique to humans, but this is not the case. We see cases of this in single-cell organisms<sup>[23](#ref_023)</sup>, multi-cellular organisms<sup>[24](#ref_024)</sup>, such as slime mold, where, when faced with scant resources, certain cells will sacrifice themselves for the sake of the greater organism.<sup>[25](#ref_025)</sup>, virulence parasites<sup>[26](#ref_026)</sup>, plants<sup>[27](#ref_027)</sup>, to name a few. Of course, in society, this is clearly exemplified in soldiers willing to die for their country, as well as countries willing to send their soldiers into war.

Quoting the paper published in *the International Academy of Ecology and Environmental Sciences*, “Invasive cancer as an empirical example of evolutionary
suicide”<sup>[28](#ref_028)</sup>:

> In recent years, a large portion of the literature has focused on evolutionary suicide. ''Darwinian extinction'' or evolutionary suicide it is one of the most important findings in adaptive dynamics \[which inevitably bring us to the conclusion\] that evolutionary theory falls short of adequately explaining the phenomenon of life in its fullness and complexity. This is due to the fact that \[evolutionary suicide\] is not a rare or special case and that it can occur in the most common ecological conditions.

This perspective is reasonable and does a better job of explaining how any why life operates the way it does. With ideas such as wave functions and the many-worlds theory of quantum physics, the morphic field of biology, the research into hyper-time telepathic communication (for long-distance space travel), self-determining AI, etc., it's easy to see how what we accept as “reasonable” will dramatically change as we learn how these new processes of reality work.

Some may see this as an example of “Intelligent Design.” We prefer the term “Coherent Integration” to represent an integrated self-similar pattern of moving energy that extends far above and below that sliver of the reality spectrum that we are attuned to perceive.

#### **Claim 24:** There is an order to creative processes, and creations themselves are a product of order. 

Redundancy + Reason = Cycles
----------------------------

Cycles are the way we describe *“any complete round or series of occurrences that repeats or is repeated.”* Cycles, as we understand and define them, are the product of applying reason to the redundancies and repeating patterns we observe around us, and even within us.

How have we used our reasoning skills to understand the nature of reality and our universe? As a starting point, we can begin by looking at how we believe this reality came into existence in the first place.

Here are some of the more popular ideas that represent our best reasoning abilities about how everything that exists began.

### Big Bang

This seems to be the most popular theory, which states that 14 billion years ago, there was nothing and nowhere, the primal void. Then, for reasons unknown, something the size of a subatomic particle appeared in this void of nothingness and in a fraction of a second, expanded to fill the entirety of the void (which is estimated to be about 90 billion light-years wide, so far).

Can you see the relationship between the Big Bang Theory and the harmonograph as a device that takes an initial push and then takes some time to create a two-dimensional design on a blank surface as that initial energy slowly diminishes? If one could imagine a 12-dimensional harmonograph with countless variables in each dimension, one might be able to imagine how it could ‘draw' a 3-dimensional universe.

### Eternal Inflation

This is also called a ‘Level II Multiverse' and states a) after the big bang the universe never stopped inflating, b) that this has been going on for an infinite amount of time and c) it continually creates new universes (multiverses) that also exist for infinite time. It is not clear how something can have a beginning, can be created, and yet exist for infinite time as there can be no ‘beginning' to infinite time, but we're talking quantum theory stuff, so, I guess anything is possible in that world where time and space may mean something different then what we are used to.

### Oscillating Universe

Also called the ‘cyclic model', and involves an endless series of Big Bangs, followed Big Crunches, and is explained by the collisions of high-dimensional ‘membranes' in a higher-dimensional space.

The question this model raises is, does the ‘memory' of the previous ‘bangs' service each crunch? We address the idea of universal memory later, so we won't get into out here other that ask, is each new bang a hard reset?

### Holographic simulation hypothesis 

The idea that reality is “just” a simulation has been around for a long time. The roots of such an idea go back to the “Skeptical hypotheses” of ancient Greece and the “The Butterfly Dream” of 3rd century B.C. Chinese philosopher Zhuang Zhou. These ideas found more form in the “Cartesian doubt” of René Descartes, finally culminating in Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom's “Simulation hypothesis” theory and book *“Are you living in a computer simulation?”* in 2003 (also a doumentary<sup>[29](#ref_029)</sup>).

This theory that we live in a simulation has moved out of the philosopher's chair and into the science lab where bits of supporting evidence was discovered.

In this scenario, the Big Bang would be the equivalent of a cosmic hackers flipping the “on” switch to their Reality Framework Server.

This theory posits that reality is a simulated projection and black holes are the projectors, with the *event horizon* of a black hole (the point from which nothing escapes) acting as a diffraction grid for the energy it is projecting to form a ‘reality', just like a hologram.

We think of this world as analog, but it may well be digital, but at a level of resolution far beyond our ability to grasp. This grid is made up of a series 1's and 0's, each 'bit' occupying a square Plank length. To put this in perspective, the number of ‘bits' on the surface of *V616 Monocerotis*, our nearest black hole a mere 3,000 lightyears away, is around 2.3313x10<sup>88</sup>. There are only 10<sup>82</sup> atoms in the universe (we think), so, that is a big number.

This is just from one of the 100 million black holes in our galaxy alone, and we already know of 500 billion galaxies just within our range of observation, so we know of at least 5 x 10<sup>19</sup> “reality projecting CPUs” (for lack of a better term), that are all working in perfect synchronization.

Even more mind-bending is the possibility that the reality that is being projected is only ‘rendered' on-demand, i.e. this reality simulation creates wave functions of possibilities but they only ‘collapse' into form when they are observed. Apparently creating actual physical reality is a ‘CPU' intensive task… or perhaps this reality was developed by creators that could only get their hands on a low-end simulator.

I would also question the use of the word “simulation”, for that implies it is an artificial rendition of something that already exists. It is more like a bona fide creation, albeit one that may have been designed around a specific model, or for a specific (yet unknown) purpose.

What is missing in these descriptions and current theories are many of those ideas that are not based in science, but rather legend, creation myths and beliefs. I don't include them not because they are not valid, but simply because there are too many of them, but modern theories are surprisingly in-line with the creation myths of the Judeo-Christian, Islam, Hindu, Zoroastrian, Taoist, Buddhist and even Aboriginal Australian, the world's oldest
civilization<sup>[30](#ref_030)</sup>. We would expect to see this similarity between radically different models of reasoning if they were all attempting to understand the same thing.

The common thread of modern and ancient creation theories and stories is that they are all versions of the plotline that there was *nothingness*, followed by a *somethingness*, and everything that ever did or ever will exist does so between these two states of chaos.

#### **Claim 25:** All dualities stem from the first duality. 

### What Goes Where? 

If the two opposing end-points of the spectrum of our reality are somethingness and nothingness, that leaves a lot of space for pretty much anything to exist.

The range of possibilities between these two (or any two) states is naturally distributed and looks something like your standard Bell curve. There is a very good reason for this: because the probabilities of what can happen between two states, regardless of the number of variables at play, will always tends toward a *normal* distribution, in the statistical sense of the word.

If we had the Ultimate Bell curve between the states of nothingness (high entropy) and somethingness (low entropy), the part of the curve that represents the most sustainable condition of these two states would in the middle. This will be the point where there is the least amount of disorder and the highest probability for order as each side will be represented in the most balanced, and therefore sustainable, manner. This chart below is a general concept of this idea.

<center><img src="media/021-supercurve1.png" style="width:90%" /></center>
We see this sort of distribution everywhere in nature. In fact, in the world of theoretical biology, this is called *environmental dimensionality* and describes how various biological systems
coexist.<sup>[31](#ref_031)</sup>

#### **Claim 26:** The most likely and persistence state of anything (including ideas) that exists between two poles will be where the most balance exists between those two poles. 

#### **Claim 27:** Order emerges most efficiently in a balanced state. 

For example, the human eye sensitivity chart below shows that a particular shade of green (555nm) is the most dominant color because this is the middle of the range of our biological sensitivity to light. This shows that the most efficient (most energetically ordered) function of our eyes is the perception of the color green. This makes sense as we evolved in a world that was very green. Other animals have other ranges of sensitivity depending on their context or environment.

<center><img src="media/022-eyecurve1.png" style="width:90%" /></center>
The oscillations between two states, be they the two states of chaos, order, and disorder, or any two points that are different yet can form an interaction, is the most basic form of energetic expression in all the orders of creation.

This is one area where metaphysics, spirituality, and science all happily converge: everything exists in a duality of some sort.

Were this duality to no longer exist in a state of imbalance or difference, the cycles of creations would also cease. How, then, is a stable state of imbalance always maintained? Remember the example of the two lakes, one higher than the other? Once all the water has moved to the lower lake the water just sits there, doing nothing, and that is the end of the cycle unless somehow the water gets moved back into the higher lake. Nature does this quite effectively by drawing up the molecules of water from the lake into the sky, transporting them via clouds, and dropping them back into the lake, thereby ensuring the cycle of energy remains operating. Difference must be maintained for energy to work, and nature's job seems to be to maintain a perfect balance of difference.

Waves
-----

When we look at simple waves, such as light waves, radio waves, sound waves, we see an oscillation of energy. This is the result of movement of energy over time.

On the atomic level, there are electromagnetic waves, such as light, X-rays, radio waves, etc. On the material level, we have mechanical waves, such as sound waves. On the organic level and beyond (planets, life, culture, politics,
etc.<sup>[32](#ref_032)</sup>) we don't use the term *waves*, instead, we call them *cycles*, but they represent the same thing.

<img src="media/023-sinewave.png" style="float:right;width:1.39792in;height:0.49861in" />If we look at a typical wave model, which is one cycle of a quantity of energy moving over a period of time, we say that the time it takes to complete one cycle is the frequency, and the distance it covers in one cycle is the wavelength.

Typically we use the terms that describe a wave to describe radiation and vibration, such as light and sound, but we *could* say the moon has a wavelength of about 50 million km, with a frequency of 0.00599584916 Hz, or that migration cycle of the Arctic Tern, a bird that flies back and forth between the Arctic and the Antarctic every year has a frequency of 1/yr., with a wavelength of 70,000 km (which is how far they travel every year).

We don't because it's cumbersome, non-intuitive and fairly useless information in our current paradigm.

As meaningless as these terms are for such cases, it does not take away from the idea that these natural cycles are the expressions of the same law that light waves operate under, but on a different level of expression, on a higher order of complexity, size and dependency where instead of photons we have birds and planets.

Here's another example of the interdependent cycles of cohabitating rabbits and coyotes. It might sound ridiculous to compare X-rays with prey-predator cycles, but both of them share the most basic functions, the transference of energy in an attempt to create balance, just in two very different scopes and contexts.

<center><img src="media/024-predcycle.png" style="width:65%" alt="predator.png" /></center>
Let's compare the properties of two classes of waves; electromagnetic (subatomic particles) and mechanical (particles).

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th><strong>Mechanical Waves</strong></th><th><strong>Electromagnetic Waves</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Travels fastest in the densest matter<br />
(diamond)</td><td>Travel fastest in the least dense matter (vacuum)</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Caused by the amplitude of energy</td><td>Caused by the amplitude of energy</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Has a theoretical speed limit of the speed of light, <em>c</em> (but the fastest recorded speed of an M wave was measured in a diamond, traveling at 18,350 m/s, about 1/16557 the speed of <em>c</em>. )</td><td>Has a theoretical speed limit of the speed of light, <em>c</em></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Has longitudinal waves<br />
(the medium vibrates parallel to the wave direction)</td><td>Has longitudinal waves<br />
(but they fall off and become negligible after just a few wavelengths)</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Has perpendicular waves (transverse waves, where the medium vibrates perpendicular to the wave direction)</td><td>Has a perpendicular magnetic field</td></tr></tbody></table>

Yes, for all you physicists and electrical/mechanical engineers that might be reading this with extreme incredulity, the differences between electromagnetic (EM) and mechanical (M) waves are many. We would expect energy to express its movement quite differently when operating under the laws of subatomic particles than that of matter. To put this in perspective, consider that an electron is 100 million times smaller than an atom, and 20 trillion times smaller than a chromosome, let alone the sizes we are talking about for typical M wave medium, like things you can hold in your hand. Compare that to the Milky Way galaxy, which is 167,256,410 times the size of our solar system, and the earth is only 1/38000 the size of that. The difference between an electron and a beach ball is about the same difference between a beach ball and the entire galaxy. With that in mind, consider that the ratio of the actual universe compared to the observable universe is equivalent to an atom compared to the observable universe. It's easy to imagine how things might operate a little differently at these different scales.

<center><img src="media/025-beachball.png" style="width:90%" alt="beachball.png" /></center>
More important than the differences are the similarities, such as the way energy travels through a medium via waves. All forms of energy are simply a redirection of energy from one state to another, as energy is neither created nor destroyed. This is the very first law of thermodynamics, the conservation of energy. We have identified many forms of energy: sound, chemical, radiant, electrical, atomic, mechanical, elastic, ionization, gravitational, dark (that's the energy causing the universe to expand faster than we think it should), so is it unreasonable to imagine still more forms of energy? Are emotions like love or fear, desires, thoughts, or even imagination a redirection of energy? And what form does that energy take? Can we say that we know of every type of medium and every type of cycle and the laws that control them?

We can only recognize energy as one form or another, not as pure energy itself. An everyday example of this is the fact that you can't see or detect light until the light energy hits something, like a wall or a dust particle. The real mind-bender here is that the dust particle itself is just energy (as all mass is energy according to *m = Ec<sup>2</sup>*), so we can only see one form of energy when that energy interacts with another form of energy. As everything is energy interacting with energy it is easy to understand why we claim that everything that exists (i.e. has sustainable patterns of energy) must oscillate in some sort of medium and that we are not aware of every form of medium or expression of energy that exists.

We do not have words for many things as we have yet to recognize them and therefore can't describe them, measure them or even identify them. It is not just reasonable to speculate that in the realm of ideas and forms there are also cycles and a medium that is completely new to us, it's quite unreasonable not to.

#### **Claim 28**: We can only see the interactions of energy, and not the energy itself. 

This begs the questions “What *is* energy? ” And the answer is… are you sitting down? Drumroll, please... *“The ability to perform work.”* Yup, that is the culmination of thousands of years of research and investigation in search of an answer as to why and how reality exists. Problem solved (we'll come back to this later).

#### **Claim 29:** A high state of order delivers more “work”

Simple Cycle
------------

Let's look at the simple cycle again as the archetypal pattern that describes the movement of energy, regardless of the medium. In some contexts, this pattern is quite measurable, in others, it is analogous, such as in the migration pattern of the Arctic Tern.

<center><img src="media/026-sinewaveplus.png" style="width:90%" /></center>
You can easily see the relationship between the oscillations of the two poles to many classic ideas of archetypal dualities, such as masculine/feminine, yin/yang, dark/light, etc., as well as the dualities that make up our day-to-day lives, such as day/night, summer/winter, phases of the moon and the movement of planets, the alternating current of common electricity, etc., and countless other dualities that the mind has imagined, created, or discovered since humans started observing the world around them.

In humanity's quest to understand reality, either through religion, economics, alchemy or science, we keep bumping into the same universal constants and concepts.

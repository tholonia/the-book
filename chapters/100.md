# INTRODUCTION
The concept that this reality is an illusion, a matrix, a simulation, or a dream, is not a new one.  From the very earliest creation stories of &ldquo;*God created the heavens and the earth*&rdquo; or up to our modern versions of the &ldquo;*Simulation Hypothesis*&rdquo;, the story of creation has been the same.  It goes something like this:  Once upon a time there was nothing and within that nothingness something appeared.  The details are left to be filled in by the imagination of scientists, mystics, philosophers, and poets, all seeking insight into the meaning and purpose of life, as if how one lives their life depends on whether their purpose here is to find happiness, provide food for Archonic overlords, or no purpose at all, as this is all a dream within a dream.  This book does not attempt to answer any of these questions.  This does not mean that is doesn&rsquo;t answer some of those questions, but just like the questions, the answers can mean many things to many people.

This book is meant to describe the blueprint of creation, similar to a blueprint to a house, which only speaks to how a house is built, not what happens inside the house, how it will be used, or who did the actual building.  For those who believe life is a journey towards enlightenment, this is the blueprint of that path.  For those who believe they are enslaved in a matrix, this is the blueprint of that prison.  For those who believe life is a dream, this is the blueprint of the mind of the dreamer.

This book means to introduce the idea that the mechanics of existence and reality, from atoms to cultures to galaxies, follow the same laws and have the same structure as it applies to their context.

The arguments put forth seemed fairly self-evident at the time writing.  However, when I passed some of these ideas by an actual philosopher he was able to follow the arguments all the way back to the originating premise from which this book claims all structure stems, at which point he firmly rebuked the idea that life has any sort predetermined direction.  His counter argument was simply that the only valid claims are those of subjective beliefs.  So, your mileage may vary.

In this writing I try to avoid social and cultural contexts as much as possible, and where they do exist, I try to keep them to a minimum.  The conclusions put forth here apply to society and culture, as well as science, politics, economics, self-realization, and life itself.

Keep in mind that these conclusions are my own, drawn from connecting the dots laid out in the following pages.  It is not my intention to promote my own conclusions, but rather, use them as an example of how one person has connected these dots.  It is the *dots* that give clues to the objective structure of reality.  How we connect them may be a subjective experience.  You may connect these dots differently, or, you may not see anything worth connecting at all;  just a bunch of random concepts that have no relationship to one another, in which case, this will be a very boring book.

The reason this book is open-sourced is to allow other&rsquo;s insights to be integrated onto this skeleton in the hope that a clearer picture of the mechanics of existential awareness will continually evolve and emerge.

**On a more mundane note…**

For those readers who are sticklers about writing style conventions in the U.S., I have deliberately chosen to: Place punctuation (that is not part of a quote) outside of quotes.  The convention of placing punctuation inside the quotes was adopted due to the limitations of fixed width fonts in the pre-digital age.  The British convention has punctuation outside of quotes, but that is because they use single quotes, not double quotes.  To quote William Strunk and E. B. White, &ldquo;[t]ypographical usage dictates the comma be inside the marks, though logically it seems not to belong there&rdquo;.  I agree, and take the side of Canadian poet, typographer and author Robert Bringhurst who bravely stated that it “makes no *typographic* difference” if quotation marks “follow commas and periods or precede them”. Also, I follow periods with two spaces, not one.  The two-space rule was also in place due to fixed width fonts, but unlike the punctuation-quotes rules, it has fierce opposition. Even the American Psychological Association has gone from officially recommending one space, then recommending one *or* two spaces, then back to two spaces (in their 6th addition), then back to one space (7th edition). This does not inspire confidence in their craft. I will be using two spaces because it has been shown that using two spaces after a period increases text processing ability[^1].  In addition, while it is customary to spell out numbers in a sentence, for the most part, numbers in a sentence will be shown as numerals. This is to allow for numerical values to be easily recognizable, which, like the above point, increases text processing overhead.

Finally, my apologies for the sometimes crude and rather ugly layout of the book in general. Once-upon-a-time I was myself a young typographer, but in those pre-digital days, the job often included the re-melting of lead "pigs" that were used to set the type (and this was for the second largest newspaper in a New England state), yet I prefer that toxic drudgery to the seemingly impossible task of getting plain text (as Markdown format) into a properly formatted manuscript - in 2020! What you see here is the best I was able to produce, but falls quiet short of what I was aiming for.

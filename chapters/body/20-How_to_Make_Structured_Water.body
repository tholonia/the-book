One of the archetypes of Ideas is form.  This would then suggest that ideas can alter form, which can alter an instance of form.  Tholonically speaking, that is exactly right.  The mere thought of something has some effect on the instantiated form of that thought.</span></p><p><span>This is relevant to creating structured water, or any creative process, but water seems to be a particularly sensitive medium.  The thoughts you impose on the water have an effect on the water.  Although not scientifically proven, Dr.  Masaru Emoto</span>&rsquo;<span>s work with </span>&ldquo;<span>water consciousness</span>&rdquo;<sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-1' name='ref-footnote-1'>1</a></sup><span> makes this same claim and purports to show significant evidence.  Personally, I am disappointed he has refused to subject his methods to scrutiny, and to be honest, it raises doubt in my mind as to the validity of his claims, but looking at this only from a tholonic perspective, it is a valid hypothesis.</span></p><p><span>Simply focusing your thoughts on the water will have some effect.  Of course, increasing the structure the water (or returning it to its natural state) will create a far better medium for interacting with energy.</span></p><h3><a name="manually" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Manually</span></h3><p><span>Vortexing (whirlpooling) water by hand was shown to be effective in improving growth differences in plant tests, but it is not easily applied to larger-scale needs.  There also does not seem to be one standardized accepted technique to manually structuring water.  One technique that seems to be popular is a homemade version of the same technique used in some of the industrial-sized units, and that is simply using marbles as a water filter.  The reasoning behind using marbles is that water in its natural, more structured state due to its movement over and through the terrain, such as rivers that move water to flow over rocks, trees, etc.  Tap water, on the other hand, is unnaturally processed, stored in stationary reserves, channeled through pipes, and a number of other modifiers that destroy this natural structure.  Running the water through a marble filter causes the water to form many small eddies as it is constantly divided and reunited, allowing the water to return to its natural, more structured state.</span></p><p><span>People have reported favorable results by simply filling a tube with glass marbles, pouring water in one end and collecting the water on the other end.  The processed can be repeated numerous times.</span></p><p><span>From a tholonic perspective, this technique would be predicted to have some effect as we are forcing a tetrahedral compound (water) to reorganize itself.  Even more so, if the marbles themselves had a structure, such quartz or metal, we would predict to see even more noticeable results, because we claim that structure is the result order, order is the result of energy, energy has fields and fields have induction.  </span></p><p><span>Another technique is to simply create a vortex in a container of water.  This can be easily done with some small tubes and a water pump, or a chemical stirrer, which spins a magnet inside the water.</span></p><p><span>Magnets have also been used.  Although it may make intuitive sense that one could use magnets, no one seems to do a decent job of explaining how they work.  However, tholonically, using magnetic marbles would make sense as the recombination of water that results in flowing over the marbles would be subject to one field upon division and the opposite field upon reunion.  In addition, magnetic marbles represent even more structure than crystal or metal marbles.</span></p><p><span>Some of Australia</span>&rsquo;<span>s largest produce farms have been using magnetic water with phenomenal results, needing 25% less water to produce a superior product than with traditional water, according to Seven West Media, Western Australia</span>&rsquo;<span>s leading news service.</span><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-2' name='ref-footnote-2'>2</a></sup></p><p><span>Simple instructions can be found on the web</span><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-3' name='ref-footnote-3'>3</a></sup><span> for making a Hero</span>&rsquo;<span>s Fountain (named after the first-century Greek mathematician Heron who discovered this process of an energy-free recycling water fountain) that constantly cycles water through a loop.  Fill one of the bottles with marbles, or whatever you like, and when the cycle is complete, you have a bottle filled with restructured water.</span></p><h3><a name="commercial-attachments" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Commercial Attachments</span></h3><p><span>Devices such as the Martin-Wasserwirbler (MW) attachment are small devices that claim to restructure water typically by creating a vortex within the device.  The Martin-Wasserwirbler (developed in Germany) is an attachment that forces the water through a series of vortex-creating channels made of oppositely charged metals.  I am slightly suspicious of this last bit as they say they use silver and gold as the oppositely charged metals, but both of these metals have similar ionization and electronegativity properties, so unless they are doing something to these metals to change that, it</span>&rsquo;<span>s not clear how they can be oppositely charged.  This is not to say they are not, just that it is unclear.  </span></p><p><span>We will pay particular attention to the MW device because it was the first device to create structured water whose ideas was originally conceived by the brilliant Viktor Schauberger, the Austrian forest caretaker, naturalist, parascientist, philosopher, inventor and biomimicry experimenter, and his son Walter Schauberger, both of whom studied the qualities of water.</span><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-4' name='ref-footnote-4'>4</a></sup></p><p><span>The idea that the qualities of water lost due to it processing could be reintroduced by creating a vortex with the water was originally brought up in 1972 in a conversation with civil engineer Wilhelm Martin, who was working on ways to improve tap water.  In 1997 Martin published his paper </span>&ldquo;<span>Experimente mit Leitungswasser </span>&rdquo;<span> (Experiments with Tap Water)</span><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-5' name='ref-footnote-5'>5</a></sup><span>.  In that paper, he describes the Martin-Wasserwirbler (Martin Water Vortex) and his 30 years of experimentation with the concept.</span></p><p><span>Tests with the MW have shown positive results, such as a rise in pH, oxygen content, and a decline in water temperature.  Unfortunately, there are no tools that exist to measure many of the qualities of water that we believe are its most important, which is the manner water moves, stores and transmits energy.</span></p><h3><a name="industrial-solutions" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Industrial Solutions</span></h3><p><span>Pursanova is a company that makes complete water processing system for residential, commercial and industrial applications.  Their products range from $20 to many thousands.  They have a number of case studies on their website (</span><a href='http://pursanova.com/'><span>http://pursanova.com</span></span></a><span>) which are astounding.</span></p><p><span>Disclaimer: I have no relationship with any of these companies and am not promoting any of their products.

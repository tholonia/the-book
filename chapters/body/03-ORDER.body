Everything is made of atoms, and atoms are the size they are because of </span><em><span>Planck</span>&rsquo;<span>s constant</span></em><span>, which is the relationship between the mass and the frequency of the particles that make up an atom.

In short, Bohm describes this theory by stating:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>In the enfolded </span><span>[</span><span>or implicate</span><span>]</span><span> order, space and time are no longer the dominant factors determining the relationships of dependence or independence of different elements.  Rather, an entirely different sort of basic connection of elements is possible, from which our ordinary notions of space and time, along with those of separately existent material particles, are abstracted as forms derived from the deeper order.  These ordinary notions, in fact, appear in what is called the </span>&ldquo;<span>explicate</span>&rdquo;<span> or </span>&ldquo;<span>unfolded</span>&rdquo;<span> order, which is a special and distinguished form contained within the general totality of all the implicate orders.</span></p></blockquote><h5><a name="bohm-ldquowholeness-and-the-implicate-orderrdquo" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>~</span><span>Bohm, </span>&ldquo;<span>Wholeness and the Implicate Order</span>&rdquo;</h5><p><span>To demonstrate this concept, Bohm uses an ink droplet analogy.  In this demonstration, he places three drops of ink into a cylinder of glycerin.  He then spins the cylinder which </span>&ldquo;<span>mixes</span>&rdquo;<span> the ink droplets together.  He then reverses the spin and reconstructs the ink drops.  When the ink droplets are in their original form, at the beginning and the end of the spinning, they are </span><em><span>explicitly</span></em><span> ink droplets and have the </span><em><span>order</span></em><span> of ink drops.  When they are mixed up together, they are </span><em><span>implicitly</span></em><span> ink droplets only, and their order would be considered </span><em><span>chaotic</span></em><span> because there is no order of ink drops.  The order of the ink drops has been destroyed, but the information of that order exists as a </span><em><span>virtual</span></em><span> ink-drop within the chaos of their mixed state.</span><span>[^7]</span></p><p><img src='../Images/inkdrop-new.png' style='width:100%;' /></p><p><span>In practical terms, this theory says that when something exists in the physical world it is in an </span><em><span>explicit</span></em><span>, or </span><em><span>unfolded</span></em><span> state.  To exist in this state, it must conform to a set of rules that define the archetype of the form it will take.  When it does not conform to these rules, it still exists, but only in an </span><em><span>implicit</span></em><span> or </span><em><span>enfolded</span></em><span> state, a state we cannot see or interact with (under normal circumstances).  This state has its own rules as well but they are a super-set of the </span><em><span>explicit</span></em><span> rules, making physical reality as we know it just one sub-state that a </span><em><span>thing</span></em><span> can be in.</span></p><p><span>It is these local and universal laws that cause form to </span><em><span>unfold,</span></em><span> to </span><em><span>explicate</span></em><span> itself, self-organize, form patterns and move in accordance with these laws.  By the same token, these laws will also </span><em><span>enfold</span></em><span> or </span><em><span>implicate</span></em><span> these forms, causing them to return to an unrecognizable state.  The laws of existence are constantly moving chaos to order and order to chaos.</span></p><p><span>Here is another example that perhaps better displays the idea.  Below are four identical pages of perfectly random dots, but there are a few dots on each page that have been added.  Looking at any one page it would be impossible to detect any pattern.  As we merge the pages the randomness gets denser and denser until a pattern of order emerges.</span></p><p><img src='../Images/007-hidden-random.png' style='width:100%;' /></p><p><span>The circle is </span><em><span>implicit</span></em><span> in the random dots of each separate page, and </span><em><span>explicit</span></em><span> when the pages line up together in the proper manner.  In this example, the </span><em><span>local</span></em><span> pattern would be the random pattern on each page, which represent the scope, and the </span><em><span>universal</span></em><span> pattern would be the parts of the circle as it exists on every page.</span></p><p><span>All of this addresses the relationship between instantiation and context, in that how something comes into existence and how it is expressed is dependent on the context and scope of where it is being expressed.  This concept is not only a technical or scientific one, but also a philosophical one that we can see in Buddhism as the principle of </span><em><span>Pratītyasamutpāda</span></em><span>, which means </span><em><span>dependent arising</span></em><span>, and which states that all phenomena (</span><em><span>dharma</span></em><span>) arise in dependence upon other phenomena (</span><em><span>dharmas</span></em><span>).  More than that, it also implies that the significance of something is defined by its environment.  An obvious example of this is; a tiger in a zoo is not the same as a tiger in the wild, as they have very different existences.  A less obvious example is: imagine a blue ball that has three object properties: it is made of wood, it is blue, it is round.  It has these same properties on a table or in the ocean </span><em><span>as an object</span></em><span>, but it interacts with its environment very differently.  This same blue ball has very different </span><em><span>interactive</span></em><span> properties depending on its environment, and these properties define the ball beyond it simply being an object, such as; it falls to the table, but it floats in the ocean, it does not move on the table, but is does move in the ocean, it will deteriorate faster and in a different manner in one case vs.  the other., etc., etc.</span></p></div>

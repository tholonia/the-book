Newton’s 2nd law relates force, mass and acceleration as F=ma. Although electrical and mechanical systems are supported by different equations to describe these relationships today, it will be shown that the laws of Ohm and Newton are related and are built from the same foundation that governs the force of particles and all of matter.

[^69]: As a relevant aside, this reversing effect has a material analog called the *Janibekov effect,*(among other names). It is well established in the field of mechanics and is most easily observed in space where there is no gravity. On observing it for the first time one would think the impossible is happening, but in fact, it is a basic law of energy that we rarely get to see here on Earth.because of gravity. Imagine an asymmetrical rigid body, like a wing-nut or a or handle, rotating around one of its axis, then suddenly, it flips 180&deg;, and continues to rotate around the same axis, but in a reverse position. After a few moments, it flips again, and continues flipping back and forth indefinitely. It does this because the lowest energy state, which is the state that all matter seeks, requires the maximum amount of inertia, and the maximum amount of inertia will always be where the most mass is. Given that the object is asymmetrical, the amount of mass for each axis will change, causing the object to change position. A quick search for “Janibekov effect” will yield many fascinating videos on this phenomena. This phenomena is worth mentioning because it is a perfect example of how energy operates in form, and, presumably, in the archetypes of form as well, which, at least tholonically, are asymmetrical tholons.

[https://www.muse.jhu.edu/article/600628](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/600628). Charles Ross, the creator, describes: "1972. I had placed this simple lens set-up on the roof so the sun would burn a path across a wooden plank as the day progressed. The idea was to collect a portrait of the weather each day. As the work progressed, I noticed that the burn’s curvature was changing with the seasons. We took photos of the burns and placed them end to end following their curvature to see what a year’s worth looked like. The sum of days generated a double spiral figure. At first, it did not make any sense-this primitive lens set-up was producing a complex spiral shape. A few of the astronomers I showed it to said, "Well, it must be coming from somewhere, but we have no idea what it is". Most of the scientists insisted that there had to be some anomaly in the set-up and that the shape had nothing to do with astronomy -just some weirdness in the lens. In reality, it made no difference at all if the lens faced one way or the other as long as it faced generally toward south. The elements of the spiral are in sunlight itself; it was an archetypal image falling from the sky. I finally contacted Kenneth Franklin at the Hayden Planetarium. He directed me to the Naval Observatory, where LeRoy Doggett, an astronomer with the Nautical Almanac office…". Authors note: This Sun Spiral was pieces together manually from many separate samples, and should not be seen as an accurate representation of the suns paths, but only an approximation.

[^306]: There are many examples, such as the *Baghdad battery* and other evidence of electricity, the largest stone pillars in the world  of  Göbekli Tepe which we could not replicate today, knowledge of heavenly bodies, the construction of the pyramids, and more.  One of the more obscure and fascinating mysteries is that of **Min**, the masculine god of fertility and sexuality, who depicted as a man with an erection, but in that depiction where he appears to be ejaculating, there is a very clear diagram of not only what looks a sperm cell, especially given its placement a context.  According to our understanding of that time, it would have been quite impossible for the Egyptians to have microscopes that were at least 100x in power.  This carving is from 2500 B.C.E.

[^320]: Interestingly, there is a relatively unknown young man, Matias De Stefano,  who was born in 1987 in a small town outside of Buenos Aries, Argentina, where he still lives, and who claims that not only was he born with full memory of his existence prior to being born, but that his "job" in this pre-incarnate reality was that of an "information specialist" or "librarian" of sorts, collecting, managing and disseminating information from all realities and dimensions.  He claims he has returned to earth to finish a mission he began thousands of years ago but failed to complete.

Whether one believes his claims or not, it is hard not to be impressed with his detailed, clear, rational, and somewhat technical explanation regarding the structure and nature of reality.  He is mentioned here because, coincidentally, he explains:

*"The 8th dimension is where you can see everything from one spot. The 8th dimension has the information of everything,  of every second over millions of years, from every perspective of the universe."*

(For what it's worth, he also says each dimension has its own form of technology, and the 9th dimension is a black hole, *"The place and time where there is no place or time"*, and the last dimension that exists in the physical reality)

Theosophists and anthroposophists call this 8 dimensional reality the *Akashic Records*, which is described as a compendium of all universal events, thoughts, words, emotions, and intentions ever to have occurred in the past, present, or future.

Here we have a Magic Crystal that is hypothesized as the source of all creation, past, and future and also happens to also be 8 dimensions.  This is mentioned not to lend or remove any validity to these various models of reality but to show how similar conceptual patterns are expressed via different philosophies and perspectives; scientific, mathematical, metaphysical, or mystical.

I also mention him here because his explanation of reality is entirely compatible with the Tholonic model, albeit less technically detailed but more complex, so for those more "spiritually" aligned, his perspective may be valuable.

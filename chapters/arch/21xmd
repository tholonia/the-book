# B - Tholonic Math

One of the fundamental claims being made here is that a coherent and stable expression of energy, in order to be sustainable, must satisfy a number of prerequisites that will ensure its sustainability.  It&rsquo;s a bit like existential bureaucracy, in that if the proper application for existence of not filled out completely and accurately, the request is denied.

Within the tholons are numerous relationships.  The one we have used in our examples are the twelve formulas that define one instance of of Newton&rsquo;s 2<sup>nd</sup> law, Ohm&lsquo;s Law.  If we map these formulas to the tholon using the reasoning described earlier, we get the following:

This shows the four trigrams that make up a tholon, however, depending on the perspective of view of the tholon the formulas will be different.  Besides the basic twelve formulas, we also see that there is a &ldquo;direction&rdquo; to some of the formulas, counter-clockwise (*left-handed*), and clockwise (*right-handed*).  We can see in the &ldquo;Sides&rdquo; sections there are 3 left-handed, 3 neutral, and 3 right-handed.  If we include the &ldquo;Base&rdquo; there are 3 left-handed, 4 neutral, and 5 right-handed.

We can enhance this diagram by showing the relationship between values that are squared and values that are square-rooted using only the *real* trigrams (i.e.  ignoring the base, *virtual*, trigram).

Here we see that wherever two corners share the same value, one of those two values is squared in the formulas.  So, we have *I* and *V* that are squared, but then we also have *I* and *V* that are the products of square-roots, which shows that the tholons naturally balances itself.

Every trigram has one edge that is a function (multiply or divide).  If we order the (*real*) trigrams by these functions we get the following:

If we organize the sides of the tholon by their function we see that we have three multiplications and six divides.  This 3:6 ratio makes sense when you consider that multiplication works the same in both directions (3&times;2=2&times;3), but division only works in one direction (because $\boldsymbol{\frac{2}{3} \neq \frac{3}{2}}$ ), so we need twice as many divisions to represent the results of multiplication.

We also see (in the image above) that in the trigrams that are division-based, three of them have clockwise flow, three of them have counterclockwise flow, and three of them flow in either direction..

In the figure above we show the three perspectives of a 2D tholon map.  Notice that the outer boundaries of each figure show a consistent direction of flow, ***Fig.  v1*** being neutral, ***Fig.  v2*** clockwise, and ***Fig.  v3*** counterclockwise, which matches the direction of the sides, however, the base (center trigram) is always counter-clockwise.

Tholonically, we can easily map things like Ragone and utility space (as in the battery example), or *laws* and *social responsibility* (as in the example of society), to a simple trigram, but it is not yet clear, to me at least, what the equivalent social expression of *I<sup>2</sup>* or $\sqrt{P/R}$ would represent.  In fact, there are quite a lot of relationships, rules, and formulas in a tholon that need more understanding.  What is presented here is the idea that the tholon can represent any system when described in its most reduced states.  This work is more akin to the Wright Brother&rsquo;s first flight rather than a modern airplane.

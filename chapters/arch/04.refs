Ohm&rsquo;s law relates voltage, current and resistance in electrical systems as V=IR. Newton&rsquo;s 2nd law relates force, mass and acceleration as F=ma. Although electrical and mechanical systems are supported by different equations to describe these relationships today, it will be shown that the laws of Ohm and Newton are related and are built from the same foundation that governs the force of particles and all of matter.

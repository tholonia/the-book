# D - New Data?

###### And i so, what does it tell us?



Applying Ohm&rsquo;s Law to the tetrahedron shows some new relationships.  Readers who enjoy numbers will find this next (short) section interesting.

So, we can satisfy all twelve formulas of Ohm&rsquo;s Law as they appear on a tetrahedron, but we can also find some new data now which may appear as useless, or may be meaningful if we know how to use it.  *&ldquo;There is no useless data, only data we have yet to understand how to use*&rdquo;  or Claim 33: All data is valid.

Previously (and in the left-most image above) we saw how the contribution of red divides the green on one side (right) <img src='../Images/right-div.png' style='width:30px'/> but constrains the green on the opposite (left) side  <img src='../Images/left-div.png' style='width:30px'/>.  Can we apply these same concepts to other scopes, such as electricity? Does current (I) &ldquo;divide&rdquo; resistance (R) and is resistance (R) &ldquo;constrained&rdquo; by current (I)?  Yes, we can, but first we have to recognize that while &ldquo;constrain&rdquo; and &ldquo;divide&rdquo; have different meanings in their usual context, they have the same mathematical meaning.  To describe the function <img src="../Images/math/315.svg" alt="\frac{X}{Y}" style="vertical-align: middle;height:14pt;"/> as X being constrained by Y, because X is being defined by, or measured by, Y is not inaccurate, as X is indeed being &ldquo;kept within certain limits&rdquo; in as far has how it is being measured.  We can then say &ldquo;resistance is defined by current&rdquo; and &ldquo;current is limited by resistance&rdquo;, both of which are technically correct statements.

In the right-most image above we have the 2D tetrahedron map with all V, I, and R values mapped to each trigram, along with the functions (&div;, &times;) that apply to the values as defined by Ohm&rsquo;s Law.  The gray functions are associated with the inner trigrams, and the black functions are associated with the outer trigram.  For example, Ohm&rsquo;s Law states that <img src="../Images/math/316.svg" alt="\frac{V}{R} =I" style="vertical-align: middle;height:14pt;"/>, so in the image above, all lines that connect V to R are assigned the &div; function.  The same goes for <img src="../Images/math/317.svg" alt="\frac{V}{R} =I" style="vertical-align: middle;height:14pt;"/> and I&times;R=V.  Note how only N-sources have the functions of &times;.

Let&rsquo;s apply values to these points to make it clearer.  Above is a tholon map where I=2, R=3, V=6 (and the implied P=12).  These numbers satisfy the formulas of Ohm&rsquo;s law as you can see by the added gray functions (i.e.  <img src="../Images/math/318.svg" alt="\frac{6}{2}=3" style="vertical-align: middle;height:14pt;"/>, etc).  These are not arbitrary numbers.  They are the smallest numbers that represent the properties of each point, mathematically speaking.  Why do we not start with the number 1 then?  Because the properties of 1 are the antithesis of creation.  1 represents perfect unity and balance, whereas every number greater that 1 represents separation and imbalance.  For example, if we applied the values of 1 to I and R, then the values of V and P will also equal 1.  The number 1 is unlike every other number, and even Euclid excluded the number 1 in his *The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic*, which states:

> Every positive integer **greater than one** can be written uniquely as a product of primes, with the prime factors in the product written in order of nondecreasing size.  **\~ Euclid, 4th century B.C.**

The number 1 is a very lonely number as it stands in a class all by itself:

- 1 is *not* a prime number, nor is it a composite number (with respect to division).
- Any number multiplied by 1 remains that number.
- 1 is its own factorial.
- 1 is its own square and square root, its own cube and cube root, etc.
- 1 is the result of the empty product, as any number multiplied by one is itself.

In fact, from the philosophical perspective of the Neoplatonists, the number 1 is not even considered a number in the traditional sense, but rather the *source* of all numbers.

So, why not start counting with 2 rather than 6? Because we assume that the children of N, when recombined, must equal N.

For these, and other reasons, we can not start counting with the number 1, but need to start with the first number that represents a product of 1, or, a number that acts like a normal number in a practical sense.

For those who enjoy playing with numbers, the following will keep you entertained for days.  I found many fascinating and significant relationships and values.  I can&rsquo;t tell you what they mean or represent, but it would be irrational to assume they have no significance without knowing anything more about them.  Everything that leads up to these new values is quite reasonable and provable.  It is just a matter of discovering where these new values and formulas apply.  To explain these new values here would border on sadistic given what the reader has had to suffer through already, and as it qualifies as a book unto itself I will spare the reader.  However, there are just a couple I would like to share.

If we look at *current* (I, red, #2) &ldquo;dividing&rdquo; *resistance* (R, green, #3), on the right <img src='../Images/right-div.png' style='width:30px'/>, and apply the function of division associated with the 6-2 vector, or side, we have 3^2^&div;2, which is simply 4.5 (which we&rsquo;ll call R~i~).  On the left we have *resistance* (R) &ldquo;constrained&rdquo; by *current* (I) <img src='../Images/left-div.png' style='width:30px'/>, which is 2^2^&div;3, which is 1.33333 (which we&rsquo;ll call I~r~).  Neither number *seems* particularly significant, but if we multiply these numbers together, which we would because they are connected via the &ldquo;base&rdquo; of the trigram, the 3-2 vector, which has the property of multiplication we get R~i~&times;I~r~=6, which is the value for V.  This proves that Ohm&rsquo;s Law has not been broken.  Using this same reasoning we can apply this to the three 6s, but as they are on a vector of multiplication, we would say 6^3^, which yields 216 (which we&rsquo;ll call V~3~).

In any case, we have new properties of R~i~, I~r~, V~3~, all of which only emerging when the the complete tholon is defined.  We can now say R~i~&times;I~r~=V.  This means we can also say <img src="../Images/math/320.svg" alt="\frac{V}{R_{i}} =I_{r}" style="vertical-align: middle;height:18pt;"/>  and <img src="../Images/math/321.svg" alt="\frac{V}{I_{r}} =R_{i}" style="vertical-align: middle;height:18pt;"/>, all in accordance to Ohms Law.  We can also calculate a new value for P as V&times;I~r~=P, but this gives us the value 8, which is a different value from P=12, so we will call this P~1~.  Let&rsquo;s test that these values by applying the other formulas and see if we get the correct results.  We can apply the formula I~r~^2^&times;R~i~=P~1~ where we&rsquo;d expect P~1~ to equal 8, and it does. <img src="../Images/math/322.svg" alt="\frac{P_{1}}{I_{r}} =V" style="vertical-align: middle;height:18pt;"/> also gives the correct answer of 6.

We have exposed at least four new values within the tholon map; R~i~, I~r~,  V~3~, and P~1~ (being 4.5, 1.333, 216, and 8 when I=2, R=3, V=6, and P=12).  Now all we have to do is find out what they mean and where they are applied in the real world.

Regarding V~3~, 216, however, well, this is a fascinating number that has a history that goes back to at least Plato, because we know (generally accepted by experts) that 216 is called *Plato&rsquo;s Number* and was described to Plato by Socrates who said (when explaining how to properly breed humans):

> For the number of the human creature is the first in which root and square multiplications (comprising three dimensions and four limits) of basic numbers which make like and unlike, and which increase and decrease, produce a final result in completely commensurate terms.

*(The word &ldquo;cubed&rdquo; was not in use in those days, but 216 is the first (smallest) cube which is the sum of three cubes.  It also makes more sense how this might apply to human breeding when you know that back in the day odd numbers were considered male and even numbers were considered female.  Math class back then must have been a lot more interesting.)* 

Plato elaborated on this in his &ldquo;Republic&rdquo;:

> Now for divine begettings there is a period comprehended by a perfect number, and for mortal by the first in which augmentations dominating and dominated when they have attained to three distances and four limits of the assimilating and the dissimilating, the waxing and the waning, render all things conversable and commensurable with one another, whereof a basal four-thirds wedded to the pempad yields two harmonies at the third augmentation, the one the product of equal factors taken one hundred times, the other of equal length one way but oblong,-one dimension of a hundred numbers determined by the rational diameters of the pempad lacking one in each case, or of the irrational lacking two; the other dimension of a hundred cubes of the triad.  And this entire geometrical number is determinative of this thing, of better and inferior births.  **\~Plato, &ldquo;Republic&rdquo;**

The above has been interpreted to mean 6^3^, which Plato alludes to elsewhere, as 6 (considered the number of marriage back then) is the product of female (2) and male (3), and 2^3^ &times; 3^3^ = 216.  While 216 is the most accepted answer, great thinkers in philosophy, math, chemistry physics, etc., spanning over 2,000 years, such as Aristotle, Proclus, Marsilio Ficino,  Gerolamo Cardano,  Eduard Zeller, Friedrich Schleiermacher, Paul Tannery, Friedrich Hultsch, and more, have all tried to decipher Plato&rsquo;s enigmatic text.  216&rsquo;s fame may even go back as far as Pythagoras, as it is the sum of cubes of the *Pythagorean triple* (3,4,5, hence 3^3^ + 4^3^ + 5^3^), or even Ancient Babylon.[^203]

Later in history, this pedigree number fell slightly into infamy when John the Apostle declared in Revelations that 666 was the number of the Beast (the beast that comes out of the sea, not the one that comes out of the abyss of the earth), but also the number of man.  216 might have escaped scot free if John had not specifically said that the number 666 was to be *calculated* (or *counted* depending on translation) to learn its true number.

> Here is a call for wisdom: Let the one who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man *(ed: or &ldquo;humanities number&rdquo;)*, and that number is 666 .  **\~John, Revelations 13:18 (NIV)**

Because 216 = 6&times;6&times;6, it gained a dubious reputation by association with the Beast of Armageddon and started popping up in some strange places, thanks to humanities generally suspicious nature and love of doom.  Fans of the arcane ignore the most likely suggestion that John may have been telling to reader to *add* the numbers together, because in the original Greek it was penned as 600+60+6, and not &ldquo;Six hundred threescore and six&rdquo;, as it appears in the most popular King James Bible.  However, the odd coincidence that John&rsquo;s number of man (666), which needed to be calculated, has a strong relationship with Socrates&rsquo; &ldquo;number of the human creature&rdquo; (216), which also needed to be calculated, is curious… even more curious is why these old timer&rsquo;s preferred to shroud their message in incomprehensible riddles rather than just tell us the damn number! Ug… philosophers.  Regardless, 216&rsquo;s clout in the religious and mystical tin-foil-hat brigades still holds up today.  Just do an Internet search for &ldquo;216&rdquo; to see for yourself.  Coincidentally, 216 &times; 10 happens to be the years the procession of the equinox moves though each of the 12 constellations.

# E - Squares and Roots

###### What they mean in the context of this book

What is the significance of a square or square root?  We know what it means mathematically, but how would that meaning be understood in a different context, such as society or law?  The challenge with applying one relationship from one context to another is that without well-understood metrics, attributing foreign attributes to a relationship runs the risk of being very subjective, biased, and filtered through a cultural or moral lens that itself may be very biased.  This is the reasoning behind many beliefs and superstitions.  Nevertheless, we will try our best to avoid those pitfalls.

<img src='../Images/papersize.png' style='float:right;width:40%'/>If you measure the long end of any A or B series piece of paper, such as the standard A4 size of paper, and divide that length by the short edge, you get the square root of 2.  This is not a coincidence, but rather the very clever work of the Germans in 1922.  The reason for this is so that a piece of paper of the dimensions <img src="../Images/math/323.svg" alt="\frac{height}{width} =\sqrt{2}" style="vertical-align: middle;height:14pt;"/>, when folded in half (along the long edge), will remain <img src="../Images/math/323.svg" alt="\frac{height}{width} =\sqrt{2}" style="vertical-align: middle;height:14pt;"/>.  So, no matter how many times you evenly fold it in two, it will always remain the same relative size.  This can only occur when the ratio is <img src="../Images/math/324.svg" alt="\sqrt{2}" style="vertical-align: middle;height:10pt;"/>, making <img src="../Images/math/324.svg" alt="\sqrt{2}" style="vertical-align: middle;height:10pt;"/> a very self-similar or fractal concept.

2 is especially unique in the way it is the only number where 2^2^ = 2&times;2 = 2+2 = 4.  No other number has the same value when squared, added or multiplied (except 0).  Tholonically, 1 point is nothing but a concept that has no dimension or form, but 2 points is the first instance of a duality and dimension, making it the most fundamental number of creation, or the transition form concept to form, so we would expect to see some property of self-similarity given that self-similarity, is a fundamental property of existence.  Perhaps that is why the number 2 is not only the first prime number, but the only even prime number as well.  It may also be the only number that inspired a murder (allegedly).  We already told the story of Hippasus, but what wasn't told was that along with his other crimes, he broke the sacred belief that all numbers must be expressible as fractions by proving that <img src="../Images/math/324.svg" alt="\sqrt{2}" style="vertical-align: middle;height:10pt;"/> was an irrational number.  His discovery was declared &ldquo;Fake News&rdquo; and he was promptly dumped at sea (or abandoned on a deserted island).

<img src="../Images/math/324.svg" alt="\sqrt{2}" style="vertical-align: middle;height:10pt;"/> is also the basis of the less famous ratio called the Silver Ratio, which is similar to the Golden Ratio. Both of these, and more, are members of what is called the *Metallic Ratios*; gold, silver, bronze, copper, etc.  While the Golden Ratio&rsquo;s mean is between 1 and 2 (1.618), the Silver Ratio&rsquo;s mean is between 2 and 3 (2.414), the Bronze Ratio between 3 and 4, and so on.  Here are the first three of the Metallic Ratios:

*(Technically, the first pattern in this series is <img src="../Images/math/325.svg" alt="\frac{0+\sqrt{{2}^2}}{2}" style="vertical-align: middle;height:24pt;"/>=1, but as it is not a series, just the number 1, it is not included, but is also based on 2.)*

The Golden Ratio is often credited for Silver Ratio accomplishments, such as the spiral of the Milky Way, facial proportions, architecture (especially in Japan), bird flight patterns, and more.  Notice how the Silver Ratio is the only ratio that can be determined by only using the number 2 (plus the number 1, which isn't a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; number).

Here are some thoughts as to how squares and square roots might apply to non-math contexts.

When we square something, the units-of-measure and the unit-count are the same.  For example, 6^2^ , *or 6&times;6*, says we have 6 counts of a unit-of-measure that equals 6.  The thing we are measuring, and the units-of-measure are the same.  We are using 6 as an objective unit-of-measure to measure something that is essentially subjective.

Why is it subjective? Because when we say *a&times;b*, we are saying we are counting *b a* times.  It says nothing about what *b* is, only that whatever it is, there are *a* of them (of course, this works in reverse as well).  Without knowing what *b* is, the result is meaningless.  How do we know what *b* is? We simply assign a meaning to it.  We say *b=apples* or *b=volts*, or whatever.  The value of *a* is objective because regardless of what the units are, there are *a* of them.  The meaning of *b* is subjective in that it requires a contextual value, a personal decision, to make that assignment.  It may not be subjective in the sense that there really are 2 apples, which is objectively testable, but the assignment of those apples to the abstract concept of a unit is. *(Again, let me stress that in actual math these concepts don&rsquo;t apply, or of they do, in ways yet unclear. We are simply applying the rules of logic to a non-mathematical context, which was the de rigueur of the inventors/discoverers of math and geometry once-upon-a-time.)*

This is effectively the same distinction between *quantitative* and *qualitative*:

- **Quantitative** data can be counted, measured, and expressed using numbers.
- **Qualitative** data is descriptive and conceptual.  Qualitative data can be categorized based on traits and characteristics.

This is metaphorically equivalent to something using its own properties to evaluate its own existence, not unlike the first dot that became aware of itself through the second dot, creating the two states of objective and subjective.  Remember, this is referring to the non-math contexts, so none of these claims have any mathematical relevance (probably).

This is a good place to bring the reader back to an earlier section that looked at the relationship between gravity and consciousness.  In that section we showed how the gravitational field *g* was a product of *G&times;M~1~&times;M~2~*, where (and these definitions are verbatim from the research paper.)

> G = universal gravitational constant.
> M~1~ = mass of the observing physical system (the observer).
> M~2~ = mass of the observed physical system (the observed).

Here we have the very same concept of subjective/objective, quantitative/qualitative being used to define perhaps the most fundamental force in reality; gravity.

Can we say that when something is squared, it is the objective measure of a subjective existence?  Can we see these two conditions, subjective and objective, as two dimensions of something&rsquo;s existence? We know that two dimensions defines an area, and we also know that when two 1-dimensional (lines) are at their two most contrasting position (90&deg;) they automatically define a 3^rd^ dimension that is a multiple of <img src="../Images/math/324.svg" alt="\sqrt{2}" style="vertical-align: middle;height:10pt;"/>.

Although we won&rsquo;t get into it here, in the tholonic view, trigrams, or synergetics, is a model of energy archetypes, but the cube is a model of instances.  For the record, a cube can be defined by five or more tetrahedrons (one regular and four irregular).

It seems almost silly to state something as obvious as the number 2 is fundamental to the reality of *space* as we must have 2 dimensions to have the concept of space, but regardless of its obvious simplicity, that archetype of 2 is taken for granted as it is one of the most profound concepts to exist, perhaps even more than 1 where manifest reality is concerned.

From the ancient Greeks to modern philosophers, geometry and math has been fundamental in describing and understanding the world not just from a technical perspective, but even a moral, ethical, legal and social perspective.  What follows is similar in that it uses math and geometry to support a philosophical premise.  It needs to be stressed, again, that this exploration is not intended to shed new light on math or geometry, but rather, uses math and geometry as guideposts of reason.  With that said, here is another view of the extra-mathematical significance of the number 2.

Tholonically, 2 is the result when 1 recognizes itself, or reflects itself.  If <img src="../Images/math/324.svg" alt="\sqrt{2}" style="vertical-align: middle;height:10pt;"/> = 1.414 than that is saying that is it 1.414, not 1, that brings 2 into existence, but we also claim that 1+1 created 2.  We have two true statements that are different in means but have the same ends:

- *1+1=2*
- Something that has a *qualitative* or *subjective*  value of 1.414  that is measured by its *quantitative* or *objective* value of 1.414 is also 2.

What is the difference between these two true facts?  We can say that the *original* source of 2 is *1+1* because we can only know the square root of 2 *after* we have created 2, so *1+1=2* came first, then *1.414^2^=2* followed.  That means we add two things that are not 2 (that being 1) together to get 2 and then discover there is a 3^rd^ value created that we can use to measure itself by to get 2 (that being 1.414).  The difference between 1 and 1.414 is the difference between creating something (1+1) and the creation itself (*1.414^2^*).  And what is that difference?  It appears to be 0.414 because *1.414-1=0.414* (actually, it's *0.41421356237*, but we'll just be using *0.414*).

What does 0.414 represent then? If *1+1* created 2, and *1.414^2^* describes what was created, can we say that 0.414 is the difference between the *creator* and the *created*? Let&rsquo;s go with that for now and see if it holds up.

What *is* the difference between *creator* and *created*?  Is it similar to the difference between parent and child? man and god? flower and seed?  Tholonically speaking, there are two types of tholons, that which can create new tholons, and that which cannot.  When a tholon cannot create, it is the end of the line for that form of expression.  The difference between *creator* and *created* is simply *creation*.  Creators create, creations cannot create, that is, not until they become a creator, if they can.  This suggests that measuring the number 2 by *creation* would tell us about the its ability, or perhaps potential, to *create*.

How would we define the concept of 2 by the difference between *creator* and *created*? We can measure 2 by the unit of *creation*, or put it another way, <img src="../Images/math/326.svg" alt="\frac{2}{0.414}" style="vertical-align: middle;height:18pt;"/>.

What is <img src="../Images/math/326.svg" alt="\frac{2}{0.414}" style="vertical-align: middle;height:18pt;"/> ?  It is 4.828.  And what is 4.828?  It is *1+<img src="../Images/math/324.svg" alt="\sqrt{2}" style="vertical-align: middle;height:10pt;"/>&times;2*. It is also the *tangent*(67.5) plus the *cotangent*(22.5), because each of those values equals *1+<img src="../Images/math/324.svg" alt="\sqrt{2}" style="vertical-align: middle;height:10pt;"/>* or 2.414.  This should look familiar because it is the *Silver Ratio &times; 2*.  It is many other things as well, such as the area of an octagon that is defined by 2^3^ (8) sides, each having a length of 1.  Notice how the number of sides of an octagon that has an area of <img src="../Images/math/326.svg" alt="\frac{2}{0.414}" style="vertical-align: middle;height:18pt;"/> also describes the volume of a cube whose sides are a length of 2, i.e. 2^3^.

So far, this falls more on the supportive side on the claim that 0.414 is the value of *creation*, or should we say the first value of *creation*, as there are probably many.  The 2nd value of creation seems to be the Silver Ratio:

<img src="../Images/math/354.svg" alt="silverratio" style="vertical-align: middle;height:36pt;"/>

What if we test this magic number of 0.414 on the number 3? Would be get something equally interesting? let&rsquo;s see.

<img src="../Images/math/330.svg" alt="\frac{3}{0.414}" style="vertical-align: middle;height:18pt;"/> = *7.242*, and this number also happens to be *2.414 &times; 3*, or *1+<img src="../Images/math/324.svg" alt="\sqrt{2}" style="vertical-align: middle;height:10pt;"/>&times; 3*.  Again, the Silver Ratio appears, but this time as a multiple of 3.  So far, so good, but there&rsquo;s more, because this number is also the ratio of the two sides of a right triangle when when that triangle is 67.5&deg;.  67.5&deg; is 22.5&deg; short of 90&deg; and because 22.5&deg; is <img src="../Images/math/329.svg" alt="\frac{1}{4}" style="vertical-align: middle;height:18pt;"/> of 90&deg;, it is also 

<img src="../Images/math/355.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;height:24pt;"/> of a circle.

<center><img src="../Images/22.5.png" style="width:30%"/></center>

This is fantastically elegant in so many ways, and the recurring principle seems to be the Silver Ratio, which is based in 2.

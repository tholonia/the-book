# APPENDICES
###### This book, and especially the appendices, is effectively in a permanent draft state as it is a continual work-in-progress.  Consequently, it will have “bugs”. The reader may run across typos, grammatical errors and flawed reasoning. These will be corrected with each update.  Readers should think of themselves as beta-testers and feel free to contribute corrections, suggestions, and critiques.

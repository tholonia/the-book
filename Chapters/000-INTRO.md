INTRODUCTION
============

The point of this book is to introduce the idea that the laws of existence, and everything in existence, from atoms to cultures to galaxies, follow the same laws and has the same structure as it applies to their context, at least conceptually.

The arguments put forth seem pretty self-evident, at least to me. However, when I passed some of these ideas by my friend he followed these arguments all the way to the originating premise from which I claim all structure stems, at which point he firmly rebuked the idea that life has any sort preprogrammed purpose or meaning. His counter argument was simply that one can believe anything they want to believe when it comes to the origins and purpose of reality. He is not alone. It seems that this is a belief that is shared by many nonsectarians, so much so that there are countless new-age belief systems, essentially religions for the secular, that are based on the premise that one's personal belief systems is the ultimate truth.

He and I could agree that neither of us had any claim on the ultimate truth of existence, but he took it further by saying that the manner in which we understand our reality is completely subjective. I had to agree with him on that, but this ignores the issue that this truthful statement was based on a flawed premise.

More than simply flawed, it is ultimately fatal, at least to a species or culture that persists in such a belief. The symptoms of a belief system that has no foundation in reality is quite literally a form of madness, and a large portion of modern western society seems to have adopted this belief, or worse, has been taught this belief. Consequently, western culture is suffering from the delusions of this cultural madness, all the while hailing its symptoms as virtues.

I won't say more about these symptoms, but as they will kill its host, we can safely call it a disease.

What I am far more interested in is what are the boundaries and structure of reality? If they do exist, then we should be able to identify them in every level of structure, be it atoms, galaxies or society. This is the path of the hard sciences, but even there we see the symptoms of this madness perverting the obvious conclusions of facts, at best, and at worst, denying that facts even exist.

In this writing I try and avoid philosophical, social and cultural contexts as much as possible, and where they do exist, I try to keep them at a minimum. This is because this book attempts to transcend the more worldly and exoteric systems. However, the conclusions put forth there can have a dramatic effect on society and culture, as well as science, politics, economics, self-realization, and life itself.

CHAOS
=====

###### Everything begins and ends in chaos, so this is a good place to begin.

Oxford English Dictionary gives three definitions of the word *chaos*.

These are:

-   The formless matter supposed to have existed before the creation of the universe.

-   The formless and disordered state of matter before the creation of the cosmos

-   A state of extreme confusion and disorder

I am not really sure what the difference is between the first two definitions… regardless, we'll skip over the obvious contradiction of “formless matter” existing before creation… for now.

There is also the Ancient Greek mythological definition of the word χάος, *Khaos*, referring to the void state preceding the creation of the universe or cosmos and personified in the Greek creation myths as the god who was “*the first created being, from which came the primeval deities Gaia, Tartarus, Erebus, and Nyx.”*

In physics, chaos is defined as “The property of a complex system whose behavior is so unpredictable as to appear random, owing to great sensitivity to small changes in conditions.”, but as science writer James Gleick points out<sup>[1](#ref_001)</sup>:

> “No one \[of the chaos scientists he interviewed\] could quite agree on \[a definition of\] the word itself, and so instead gives descriptions from a number of practitioners in the field. Those scientists that do have a definition are hardly in agreement, as Philip Holmes defined “chaotic” as, “The complicated aperiodic attracting orbits of certain, usually low-dimensional dynamical systems.” while Bai-Lin Hao describes chaos as “a kind of order without periodicity.”

Another term for *chaos comes from* cosmology, and that is the *primal void.*

Modern cosmology's Big Bang theory is quite compatible with this idea that before there was anything, there was nothing but a primal void, a term often used by scientists themselves. The primal void is a descriptive synonym for at least one state of chaos.

The primal void has also been called the *gap between heaven and earth*, the *abyss*, *absolute-limitless nothing*, *ex nihilo*, and a number of other terms all trying to convey the idea of total and absolute nothingness, a concept that may well be impossible for the human mind to grasp. This nothingness also includes (or rather, excludes) the concept of time, as there can be no time in a void of nothingness, at least according to Stephen Hawking.<sup>[2](#ref_002)</sup>

Everyone from scientists to mystics seems to agree that before there was something, there was nothing, and then, presto, somethingness appeared in the nothingness.

How big is nothingness? Is there a limit to nothingness? If there is, how is that defined? If there is no limit, then is nothingness infinite? There are a lot of sticky questions around the concept of nothingness, which would explain why it's symbolic representation of the number 0 (zero) is a fairly modern invention.

## Zero

Zero was first recorded in Mesopotamia around 3 B.C., followed by its appearance in Mesoamerica to the Mayans circa 4 A.D., India in the 5th century, Cambodia in the 7th and China and the Islamic countries in the 8th century. The concept of zero didn't reach Western Europe until the 12th century, and even then, was not fully accepted as a legitimate number concept for hundreds of years.

One of the conceptual challenges of zero is that this single number represents the antithesis of all other numbers. The other conceptual problem is that zero also represents the sum of all numbers! See for yourself… just start adding all numbers together and don't stop until you get to infinity… (1 + (-1)) + (2 + (-2)) + (3 + (-3)) +... = 0 + 0 + 0 + ... = 0). I am not being hyperbolic here in any way, as this is an ongoing debate in both mathematics and philosophy, and many will claim that, in fact, 0=∞! We'll let the philosophers figure that out. In the meantime, to deal with the finite world of everyday life we have adopted the practice of simply ignoring the theoretical implications of  − ∞ + ∞=0 and stick to actual things, which are quite finite, and often have no negative equivalents, like the number of cars in Idaho or the number of tomatoes consumed annually.

How it applies here is that we have the idea of zero or nothing, and the idea of everything not-zero or not-nothing, which is everything. The idea of zero being the antithesis of all numbers (and possibly the sum of all numbers as well), is equivalent to the equally challenging idea that all that ever did, does or will exist does so only due to the existence of nothingness (and possibly the result of all existence as well). Even just the oxymoronic phrase “the existence of nothingness” may be an conceptual impossibility.

Nevertheless, we accept the story, in one form or another, that upon a time, before time even existed, there was an infinite void of nothingness, and then, badda-boom, badda-bing, something appeared in this nothingness… and not just any something, but the totality of all somethingness that has, does, or ever will exist.

How many things other than zero are there? In theory, infinite, but in reality, nothing is infinite. Is the somethingness that was created in the nothingness finite or infinite? This was a question that plagued philosophy and science for quite a long time[3] until Einstein came up with a clever answer.

According to Einstein's Field Equations, the universe is not infinite, but rather “finite and unbounded”, which is a clever way to say “infinite, but finite.” Think of the 2D surface of a ball. It is essentially infinite in that you can travel on it forever and never get to the end, but it is bounded, or finite, in that, it only occupies a finite space. The 3D reality that is our Universe is the same, according to Einstein, but like the 3D 'surface' of a 4D space.

I only mention this to raise the idea that the primal void in which all of existence exists may well be a big 4D ball, rather than an infinite space. True or not, I can't say, but at least it's a bit easier to get one's head around.

In either case, the idea of a primal void, or chaos, in mythology as well as cosmology, is one where there is no matter, no energy, no anything.

Some colloquial, older definitions of chaos describe it as matter before there was any energy, but as we now know that matter itself is nothing but energy, that description no longer applies.

#### Claim 1: Chaos is a state lacking any order, time or energy. Total nothingness. 

Chaos also has another definition that means exactly the opposite, similar to the ∞ = 0 concept (scientists do that a lot). Take, for example, the study of chaos in the origins of the universe that was undertaken by Chicago's Northwestern University physicist Adilson Motter, who concluded that 10<sup>-36</sup>seconds after the Big Bang happened there was a state of *total chaos*. Do you know what was happening at 10<sup>-36</sup> seconds after the Big Bang? Everything, and a temperature of over 1 trillion degrees. Motter concluded from his study:

>  “Now we establish once and for all that \[the universe\] is chaotic.”

#### **Claim 2:** Chaos is a state of total energy and matter. Total somethingness. 

We are not claiming here that the Big Bang theory is correct (because it sounds completely insane), but only ask the question; How can the concept of *chaos* describe the state of the void of total nothingness as well as the state of all matter and energy in the universe?

The definition of chaos that works for both is *“the degree that order is present in any state”*. Both of those states, of total nothingness and total somethingness, have no order, one because it is empty of anything, and the other because it is full of everything in a moment that everything was happening at once. Granted, that total state of chaos after the Big Bang only lasted 10<sup>-36</sup> seconds, but that doesn't change the fact that total chaos existed at the birth of the Universe.

#### **Claim 3:** chaos is a measure of order.

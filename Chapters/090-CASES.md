CASES & EXAMPLES
================

There have been many experiments on how thought affects external reality, but most have not been subjected to scientific scrutiny. This does not mean they are not valid by any means. Given the general direction of mainstream science, I doubt we'll be seeing much real investigation into the subject.

However, there is at least one study that stands out.

Maharishi Effect
----------------

The research report *“Effects of Group Practice of the Transcendental Meditation Program on Preventing Violent Crime in Washington, D. C.: Results of the National Demonstration Project, June--July 1993”*<sup>[121](#ref_121)</sup> published in the journal *“Social Indicators Research.”*

This study, which was monitored by a 27-member project review board comprised of independent scientists and leading citizens, found that there was a significant statistical result.

What was this study exactly?

> This study presents the final results of a two-month prospective experiment to reduce violent crime in Washington, DC. On the basis of previous research, it was hypothesized that the level of violent crime in the District of Columbia would drop significantly with the creation of a large group of participants in the Transcendental Meditation® and TM-Siddhi® programs to increase coherence and reduce stress in the
> District.<sup>[122](#ref_122)</sup>

The results were impressive.

This is only one study, so it is not definitive, but it is certainly supportive of the idea that directed intention, what the participants called *coherence*, and what we are calling *order*, has an extended effect. The explanation, according to the tholonic model, is that the directed energy of coherent thought altered the curves of various archetypes thereby altering the probability of where the “work” will produce the most order, or where and how energy will be expressed across a scope's spectrum.

### On a Personal Note

I had a particularly insightful experience with the Maharishi Effect back in the late '60s when I was a young teenager. My father was a captain of industry in the world of electrical components, ultimately becoming president of one of the pioneering companies that helped create the first integrated circuit.

Born of poor Scottish immigrants in the Bronx on the tail of the Great Depression, and serving in Korea, he was no stranger to hard times and hard work, which made him one of the most pragmatic and practical people I have ever known. He was a devout capitalist, atheist, and husband, and had no patience for anything that did not produce results. Hippies were idiots, imports were ruining the economy, Scotch whiskey was better, and talking about your problems was for whiners. You get the picture.

At the insistence of his wife (and my mother), he joined her for a seminar on *Creative Intelligence (CI)*, which was what they called Transcendental Meditation back then for those folks like my father. He heard their claims about improved mental and physical health, better focus, fewer distractions, etc. He decided to test their claims by giving all his employees in one of his factories CI training, along with an extra hour at lunch break for them to take this training and practice their new CI skills.

This factory was in a poor, rundown industrial town in New England, and the people that worked in those factories were uneducated, unskilled, assembly-line laborers… not exactly an open-minded demographic. I knew a number of them myself, as we lived in that town, and many never made it past 4<sup>th</sup> grade. The rivers in this town were dead from all the pollution, and the neighboring town had the highest per capita suicide rate in the United States. It was a dreary, dark place filled with dreary dark people.

His peers in the industry thought he was being foolish to deploy such a plan, but the results were astounding. People were fighting less, taking less sick leave, injuries were down, production went up… in general, everything improved. So much so, that the Wall Street Journal did an article on him and his ‘revolutionary' new technique. He became known as some kind of New Age Industrialist, which was ironically funny as he was as new age as his '57 Chevy.

Eventually, the program was scrapped because people began to abuse the extra time meant for CI, and everything went back to *normal* with sick leaves, fighting, injuries, and lower production.

Prayer
------

You might be thinking that traditional prayer holds the same power, but it does not. Why? Because most prayer is anything but coherent. Prayer means very different things depending on culture, religion, personal perspectives, etc. It can be anything from begging to demanding, justifying to virtue signaling, and occasionally it can be an expression of gratitude and love, but using group prayer to effect change is like using a group of blind people to paint a room by throwing handfuls of paint at the wall. Your room *will* get painted, but you'll wish it didn't.

This was recently confirmed by a $2.3-million-dollar study on the effect of prayer on the sick, involving over 1,800 patients. It was the largest study of its kind ever undertaken. Contrary to prayer helping the sick, they found that when a patient knew others were praying for them, they tended to have *more* complications.<sup>[123](#ref_123)</sup>

There are older studies that conclude the exact opposite, such as Dr. Byrd's study “Positive Therapeutic Effects of Intercessory Prayer in a Coronary Care Unit Population”<sup>[124](#ref_124)</sup> and Dr. Harris' study “A Randomized, Controlled Trial of the Effects of Remote, Intercessory Prayer on Outcomes in Patients Admitted to the Coronary Care Unit”<sup>[125](#ref_125)</sup>. However, without a detailed comparison of the studies, and specifically the manner in which the participants prayed, we cannot know to what degree coherence was at play

The difference between the coherence of Transcendental Meditation and prayer is the former follows a very specific set of rules, has a beginning, a middle and an end, has a clearly defined non-personal target subject, and never attempts to force change on someone's life situations. Prayer can follow these same rules, but it rarely does because there are no rules to prayer, other than it typically being a recognition of some culturally anthropomorphized supernatural power.

An example of coherent prayer is a practice used by the not-so-secret society of Rosicrucians. Members who have reached a certain level of initiation are introduced to a schedule of ‘prayers'. This is a schedule of times when people are requested to focus their energy on a particular topic, such as health or family or finances, etc. If one is not in need, they send their benevolence into a ‘pool' of energy specific to that topic. If one has a need in these areas they can join in at the scheduled times and ‘tap into' that pool. This is a very coherent technique because it has specific archetypal and sustainable patterns of energy, and it works surprisingly well.
